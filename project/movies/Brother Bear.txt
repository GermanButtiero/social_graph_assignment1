==Plot==
In [[Alaska]] during the early [[Holocene]] when [[Last Glacial Period|ice age]] [[megafauna]] including [[mammoth]]s and [[sabre toothed cat]]s still roamed [[Earth]], the local [[human]] [[Alaska Natives|tribes]] believe all creatures are created through the Great [[Spirit guide|Spirits]], who are said to appear in the form of an [[aurora]]. A trio of brothers, Kenai, the youngest; Denahi, the middle; and Sitka, the eldest, return to their tribe for Kenai to receive his [[totems|totem]], [[necklace]]s in the shapes of different [[animal]]s, from Tanana, the [[shaman]] of the brothers' tribe. The particular animals they represent symbolize the [[virtue]] they must achieve to call themselves men. Unlike Sitka, who gained the [[eagle]] of guidance, and Denahi, who gained the [[wolf]] of [[wisdom]], Kenai receives the [[bear]] of [[love]]. He objects to his totem, stating that bears are [[thief|thieve]]s and [[Vice|vicious]] creatures without [[feeling]]s, and believes his opinion is proven to be a fact when a [[grizzly bear]] steals their basket of [[salmon]], which Kenai did not hold properly in a hurry to receive his totem. Kenai searches for the basket and finds it destroyed.

He sees the bear, provokes it, his brothers find him, and a fight ends on top of a giant glacier. When the bear gets the upper hand, Sitka sacrifices himself to save his brothers by dislodging the glacier, although the bear survives the fall. After Sitka's [[funeral]], an enraged Kenai blames the bear for Sitka's death and rejects his totem. He hunts down and chases the bear up onto a rocky cliff, fighting and eventually slaying it. The Spirits, represented by Sitka's spirit in the form of a [[bald eagle]], arrive and transform Kenai into a bear after the dead bear's body evaporates and joins them. Denahi arrives and falsely believes that Kenai was killed by the bear from earlier. Kenai falls off the cliff and down some rapids, but survives. Denahi vows to avenge Kenai.

Kenai awakens as he is healed by Tanana and discovers his transformation to his horror and [[humiliation]]. Tanana cannot understand Kenai, but advises him to go to the [[mountain]] where the lights touch the earth to find Sitka and be turned back into a human, but only when he atones for his actions; she vanishes without explanation. Kenai quickly discovers that he can now understand the wildlife, meeting a pair of [[Alaska moose]] brothers named Rutt and Tuke. He gets caught in a trap but is freed by an outgoing bear cub named Koda. After they evade Denahi, who is still unaware that the bear he's pursuing is Kenai, Koda reveals to Kenai that his mother is missing. They make a deal: Kenai will escort Koda to an annual [[salmon run]], and then the cub will lead Kenai to the mountain nearby. Along the way, the two form a brotherly relationship and are joined by Rutt and Tuke and ride on the backs of a [[woolly mammoth]] herd. Kenai and Koda eventually continue their journey on foot. As they go through a [[volcanic]] field, Kenai and Koda are still hunted by Denahi.

Kenai and Koda reach the salmon run, where a large number of bears live as a family, including the leader Tug. Kenai accepts his new surroundings and is comfortable living with the other bears. During story time among the bears, Koda tells a story about his mother recently fighting human hunters on a glacier, reminding Kenai of him and his brothers' fight with the bear that led to Sitka's death, making him realize that the bear he killed was Koda's mother. Horrified of what he has done, Kenai runs away in a fit of guilt, but Koda soon follows him. Downhearted, Kenai confesses the truth to Koda, who runs away grief-stricken, and a remorseful Kenai leaves to go to the mountain. Meanwhile, Rutt and Tuke, having had a falling out, reconcile in front of Koda, prompting him to forgive Kenai.

On the mountain, Kenai is cornered by Denahi, but their battle is interrupted by Koda, who steals Denahi's spear. Kenai comes to Koda's aid, out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Koda's surprise. However, upon realizing that Koda needs him because of his own mistake, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear with Denahi's support. Sitka complies, and Kenai is transformed back into a bear. Koda is reunited briefly with the spirit of his mother before she and Sitka return to the spirit world. In the end, Kenai lives with the rest of the bears and gains his title as a man, through being a bear.
