PLOT: It is Lumpy's first Halloween with Winnie the Pooh, Roo, and their friends in the Hundred Acre Wood. The group discusses their plans for Halloween and for their first night of trick-or-treating. Tigger tells his friends about the dreaded Gobloon, a monster that comes out every Halloween to search for somebody to catch and will turn them into "jaggedy lanterns" if he catches them, but if the Gobloon is captured first, it will grant its captors one wish.

After Pooh accidentally eats all of the trick-or-treat candy Rabbit collected from the Hundred Acre Wood, Roo and Lumpy set out to capture the Gobloon to wish for more. According to Tigger's directions on the map, they are able to go past the Creepy Cave then down the Slimy Slide and into the Tree of Terror later on. Entering the Creepy Cave, Lumpy and his lunchbox get stuck on some rocks, which leads Lumpy to believe that they are being followed. He desperately wants to go back, but Roo insists that they should press on, and eventually they find the Slimy Slide, and then the Tree of Terror.

When Roo and Lumpy reach the supposed Gobloon's lair, Lumpy loses his courage to catch the Gobloon and wants to go home. So, Roo tells him the story from ''Boo to You Too! Winnie the Pooh'', when Piglet was afraid to go trick-or-treating but gained his courage.  An inspired Lumpy helps Roo set a trap for the Gobloon, but the two hear a sound coming from an old bridge and go to investigate.

After encountering and fleeing from a mysterious figure, whom they think is the Gobloon, with a wheelbarrow of Jack-o'-lanterns, Lumpy gets separated from Roo and ends up stuck in the trap they had set for the Gobloon. Lumpy is heartbroken to be alone, as he and Roo had promised to stay together during the adventure. Roo finds a Jack-o'-lantern resembling Lumpy, which makes him think his friend has been caught by the Gobloon and turned into a "jaggedy lantern".

Once back with the others, Roo recruits Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore, and Rabbit, who were using vegetables after Pooh ate all the candy to help him capture the Gobloon and save Lumpy. The group arrives at the trap and believes the Gobloon is trapped, unaware that it is actually Lumpy. Roo wishes to have his friend Lumpy back, but becomes bitterly saddened when the "Gobloon" does not grant his wish. Hearing Roo's voice, Lumpy calls for him, but a loud thunder blocks it, prompting him to break his way out of the trap. Roo and Lumpy are happily reunited.

The group finally goes trick-or-treating and Kanga, who was the mysterious figure from earlier, throws a Halloween party for the friends and gives them candy, complete with Jack-o'-lanterns she had carved in everyone's likenesses. As Lumpy's Jack-o'-lantern was not there, Kanga explains she made one, but must have accidentally dropped it, which turns out to be the Jack-o'-lantern that Roo found. With Lumpy's first Halloween being successful, everyone from the Hundred Acre Wood enjoys the Halloween party.
