==Plot==
One morning in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]], [[Roo]] and his friends [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]], [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]], and [[Tigger]] are surprised when they wake up to hear a loud trumpeting noise. While they visit [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit's]] house for help in determining the source of the sound, Roo discovers a trail of large, circular [[Footprint|footprints]], which Rabbit concludes to have come from a [[Heffalump]], an [[elephant]]-like creature whose species is feared by the inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood due to its supposed hostility. Per Roo's suggestion, Rabbit organizes an expedition to travel to Heffalump Hollow and capture the Heffalumps living there in order to prevent further invasions. Despite his determination, Roo is forbidden from participating in the expedition due to his young age, prompting him to start his own solo Heffalump hunt the next day.

While exploring Heffalump Hollow, Roo meets a friendly young Heffalump called Lumpy, who openly expresses his wish to find his own trumpeting call to communicate with his fellow Heffalumps. As he gets to know Lumpy, Roo soon learns that the Heffalumps are different from his friends' depiction of them and offers to take Lumpy on a tour of the Hundred Acre Wood, which Lumpy agrees to. During the tour, Roo and Lumpy play games together and form a strong friendship but not without accidentally making a mess of Pooh's house and Rabbit's garden. Meanwhile, Rabbit and the gang return home from the unsuccessful Heffalump expedition to find the mess that Roo and Lumpy made; concluding that a Heffalump was the cause of this, they begin setting up traps to catch it.

After hearing Lumpy's mother calling him, Roo and Lumpy begin to search for her, without success, which causes Lumpy to become increasingly depressed until Roo gets the idea to enlist the help of his own mother, [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]]. Roo and Lumpy soon find Kanga, along with Rabbit, Pooh, Piglet, and Tigger, who attack Lumpy after erroneously believing that he tried to kidnap Roo. Feeling betrayed, Lumpy runs away only to get trapped in a cage. Following after Lumpy, Roo frees him from the cage and the two reconcile with Kanga watching them in approval. Afterwards, Roo reveals his friendship with Lumpy to Rabbit and the others and calls them out for their prejudice towards Heffalumps.

As Roo's friends reluctantly agree to let Lumpy go, a still-scared Lumpy stumbles off a ledge and accidentally knocks Roo into a large pile of logs. When Roo's friends are unable to move the logs, Lumpy decides to use his trunk to call his mother for help, finally finding his own trumpeting call in the process. Upon hearing his calls, Lumpy's mother arrives and successfully rescues Roo. This act of heroism causes Pooh and his friends to finally acknowledge the Heffalumps' benevolence, and the two clans make peace with each other.
