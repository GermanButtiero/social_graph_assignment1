==Plot==
===Keelboat Race===
[[Tennessee]] frontiersman Davy Crockett and his best friend Georgie Russell are transporting [[Fur|pelts]] to [[Maysville, Kentucky]] after a successful season of [[animal trapping|trapping]] and hunting. On the [[Ohio River]], they encounter [[Mike Fink]], the self-proclaimed "king of the river". Fink refuses to take Crockett and Russell downriver on his [[keelboat]] unless they pay his toll, which they cannot afford.

Fink challenges Crockett and Russell to a keelboat race to [[New Orleans]], with the pelts and Fink's title as the stakes. Crockett uses his celebrity to organize his own keelboat crew for the race, which he wins despite numerous obstacles and Fink's cheating. Crockett allows Fink to keep his title, and Fink graciously gives him and Russell a ride downriver for free.

===River Pirates===
Fink drops Crockett and Russell off along the river, where they seek out [[Chickasaw]] traders to buy horses from. A Chickasaw hunting party captures them and takes them to their village, where they are preparing to go to war against white men for murdering [[Kaskaskia]] tribesmen. Crockett and Russell, having witnessed an earlier attack on Fink's keelboat but being told the Kaskaskia were driven out of the area prior, deduce that the attackers are in fact pirates masquerading as Native Americans. Crockett and Russell agree to bring the pirates to justice in exchange for peace and are released.

Fink agrees to help Crockett and Russell by posing as a banker hauling Spanish gold and stopping at various towns along the Ohio River to brag in order to draw the pirates out. The group attracts a traveling [[minstrel]] named Colonel Plug, whom Crockett agrees to take to the next town. Crockett correctly suspects Plug is in league with the pirates, led by [[Samuel Mason]] and the [[Harpe brothers]], who are hiding at [[Cave-in-Rock State Park|Cave-in-Rock]]. Plug notifies the pirates of the gold through song, but is subdued when he discovers the ruse. The pirates attack, but Fink's crew defends the boat successfully. Crockett and Russell pursue Mason and the Harpe brothers to their cave hideout, where they subdue the Harpe brothers. A keg of gunpowder explodes, sealing the cave and killing Mason. Having made peace, Crockett and Russell again part ways with Fink and head for home.
