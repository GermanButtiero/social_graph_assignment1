PLOT: ===Keelboat Race===
Tennessee frontiersman Davy Crockett and his best friend Georgie Russell are transporting pelts to Maysville, Kentucky after a successful season of trapping and hunting. On the Ohio River, they encounter Mike Fink, the self-proclaimed "king of the river". Fink refuses to take Crockett and Russell downriver on his keelboat unless they pay his toll, which they cannot afford.

Fink challenges Crockett and Russell to a keelboat race to New Orleans, with the pelts and Fink's title as the stakes. Crockett uses his celebrity to organize his own keelboat crew for the race, which he wins despite numerous obstacles and Fink's cheating. Crockett allows Fink to keep his title, and Fink graciously gives him and Russell a ride downriver for free.
