==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. Please discuss any major changes on the talk page. -->
In [[Medieval Scotland]], a young Princess Merida of [[Scottish clan|Clan]] Dunbroch celebrates her birthday and is given a [[bow and arrow]] by her father, King Fergus, dismaying his wife Queen Elinor. In the forest, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]] and follows the other wisps to her family and Mor'du, a huge demonic [[bear]], attacks the family. Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs Fergus one of his legs.

Ten years later, Merida discovers she is to be [[Marriage of state|betrothed]] to the son of one of her father's allies. Failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch; Elinor reminds Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.

The allied [[Scottish clan chief|clan chieftains]] and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Twisting the rules, Merida announces that, as her own clan's firstborn, she will compete for her own hand. She easily bests her [[Courtship|suitors]] and, after arguing with Elinor, runs away into the forest. She encounters the wisps again, who lead her to the hut of an elderly witch, where she bargains for a spell to "change" Elinor. The witch gives her an enchanted cake.

Elinor eats the cake and is transformed into a bear, unable to speak but retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the deserted witch's cottage, and discovers a message from the witch: she must "mend the bond, torn by pride" by the second sunrise, or the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor encounter Mor'du and realize Mor'du was the prince in the legend. Merida vows not to let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family [[tapestry]] she deliberately damaged during their argument.

They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but at Elinor's prompting, she instead allows the firstborns to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing their alliance.

Losing her humanity, Elinor attacks Fergus and flees the castle. Mistaking the Queen for Mor'du, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her [[Triplets|triplet]] brothers, who have become bear cubs after eating the enchanted cake. She repairs the tapestry as Fergus and the clans capture Elinor. Merida thwarts them before the real Mor'du arrives. Mor'du targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, causing Mor'du to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the spirit of the prince, who thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida covers Elinor in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. Thinking it was for nothing, Merida reconciles with her mother begging to have her back, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message. This reverses the spell's effects on her mother and brothers.

With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry, bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses together.
