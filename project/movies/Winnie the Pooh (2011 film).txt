PLOT: The film's setting takes place inside a book, which tells about the adventures of Christopher Robin and his friends Winnie the Pooh (Pooh for short), Piglet, Rabbit, Eeyore, Tigger, Owl, Kanga, and Roo, who all live in the Hundred Acre Wood and are able to fully interact with the book's narrator and text.

One morning, Pooh discovers that he has run out of honey. While searching for more, he visits Eeyore and notices that Eeyore's tail has gone missing. A contest is later held, offering a pot of honey as a prize for any participant who can find a suitable replacement tail for Eeyore, but every attempt fails.

Later, Pooh arrives at Christopher Robin's house to ask for honey, but finds him gone, and a note left behind. As Pooh shows the note to his friends, Owl reads it and concludes from the words written that Christopher Robin has been abducted by a creature called the "Backson". In response, Rabbit comes up with a plan to trap the creature by leaving a trail of items leading to a pit.

Elsewhere, Tigger, who disagrees with Rabbit's plan, decides to hunt down and attack the Backson on his own. He soon finds that Eeyore was accidentally left behind by the gang during their plot and decides to take the donkey under his wing. While training Eeyore, Tigger dresses up as the Backson to teach Eeyore how to fight. Eeyore eventually escapes from Tigger and hides underwater, where he discovers an anchor and decides to use it as a replacement tail.

While struggling to follow through with Rabbit's plan, Pooh falls into the Backson pit after finding an empty honey pot above it. Reuniting with Eeyore, Rabbit's party tries to use Eeyore's anchor to free Pooh, but its weight pulls everyone but Piglet into the pit. Piglet heads towards Christopher Robin's house to find a rope to rescue everyone, but he gets frightened off after spotting Tigger in his Backson costume. A comical chase ends with both of them getting trapped in the pit along with letters from the book's text, which Pooh uses to build a ladder for everyone to climb out. Afterwards, the group reunites with Christopher Robin, who explains that Owl had misread the letter, which actually stated that Christopher Robin had gone out and would be "back soon"; the real reason for his disappearance was that he was at school.

After the events, Pooh continues his search for honey. He soon visits Owl's house, where he discovers that Owl has been using Eeyore's tail as a bell pull, unaware of who it belonged to. Owl allows Pooh to take the tail but also offers him a pot of honey; Pooh, ignoring his hunger, declines the offer, and quickly returns Eeyore's tail. As a reward for this act of selflessness, everyone in the Hundred Acre Wood declares Pooh the winner of the tail contest and presents him with a enormous honey pot, much to his delight.

In a post-credits scene, a real Backson, who is shown to actually be a nice and gentle creature, discovers the trail of items that Pooh and his friends left and ends up falling into their pit.
