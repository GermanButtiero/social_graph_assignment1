PLOT: In New York City, 1914, a young Trudy Ederle, who is afflicted with measles, witnesses a burning ferry capsize, with that disaster leaving hundreds of the passengers dead. Her mother, Gertrude, is horrified by the incident. After learning that most of the dead were women due to their inability to swim, she resolves to have Trudy's siblings, Meg and Henry Jr., learn swimming for their survival, with Trudy barred from water due to her illness. Surprisingly, Trudy recovers from measles. She becomes fascinated with swimming, and having persuaded her stern father, Henry, to allow her, she begins to pursue the sport when she's 12. Subsequently, Gertrude has them join the Women's Swimming Association under the tutelage of the headstrong Charlotte Epstein. Trudy is initially passed over for Meg, whom Epstein favors. Nevertheless, she agrees also to train Trudy, who makes quick progress. Over time, Trudy's performance keeps improving and she wins a string of world records; however, Meg's advance is far more modest.

In 1924, the Ederles are approached by the American Olympic Union (AOU) about participating in the 1924 Paris Olympics; however, only Trudy is offered a spot. Subsequently, the U.S. women’s team is introduced to Jabez Wolffe, a swimmer who unsuccessfully attempted to cross the English Channel, as their coach. However, the sexist Wolffe prevents them from properly training, and as a consequence, Trudy only wins bronze medals in the 100 metre freestyle and 400 metre freestyle. She returns to New York in disappointment, which worsens when she discovers that in her absence, Meg has become engaged to be married in a deal orchestrated by their father.

After an encounter with Bill Burgess, the second swimmer to have successfully crossed the Channel, a re-motivated Trudy decides to attempt the feat herself. Enlisting Epstein's help, she approaches James Sullivan of the AOU to sponsor the attempt. Sullivan, an opponent of female athletics, dismisses the idea but offers to  sponsor it conditionally, provided that Trudy swims from New York to New Jersey within a three-hour deadline. Trudy easily beats the deadline and earns the sponsorship, but she is forced to pair with Wolffe as her coach.

In France, Trudy trains at the Cap Gris-Nez, where she befriends Benji, another swimmer attempting to cross the  Channel; there, she clashes repeatedly with Wolffe, who attempts to control her training. After a near-disastrous attempt by Benji, Trudy embarks on her maiden attempt on July 20, 1926. With Wolffe directing her, Trudy initially does well. However, the former, having grown jealous of the latter's progress, ''ostensibly'' spikes her tea, which disorients her and brings the attempt to an end.}} Whilst recovering, Trudy is visited by Henry and Meg, who have come to take her home; however, they are stopped by Burgess, who offers to train her, having deduced Wolffe's duplicity. 

Determined, Trudy secretly escapes from her return trip home and begins preparations for another attempt, making Burgess promise not to save her should she fail again. Meanwhile, Sullivan discovers Trudy's deception; realizing she will attempt again, he notifies the press. On August 6, 1926, Trudy begins the second attempt, this time with Burgess, Henry and Meg as her guiding team. With the press in tow, the attempt's developments are monitored worldwide. Despite enduring jellyfish stings, Trudy persists in her attempt before facing the final challenge: to cross the Goodwin Sands in order to reach England. With her guide boat unable to follow her into the shallow waters, she decides to swim alone rather than accept defeat. By nighttime, her team arrives at Dover, but while swimming in open water, Trudy loses her direction. However, the townspeople set up bonfires on the beaches as a guiding beacon for her. News of her success spreads, and upon her return to New York, Trudy is given a ticker-tape parade through the city, which she shares with her family and Epstein, crediting them for her success.

The intertitles before the film's closing credits inform that Trudy set the world record for crossing the Channel at 14 hours and 31 minutes, beating the world record held by a man by two hours. She eventually lost her hearing and dedicated her life to teaching deaf children to swim; she died in 2003 at the age of 98.
