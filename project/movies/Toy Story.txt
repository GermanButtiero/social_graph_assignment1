A group of sentient toys, who pretend to be lifeless when humans are around, are preparing to move into a new house with their young owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], his infant sister [[List of Toy Story characters#Molly Davis|Molly]], and their single mother [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]]. Learning that Andy's sixth birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to an earlier date, several toys — including [[List of Toy Story characters#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog (Toy Story)|Slinky Dog]], [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex the tyrannosaur]], [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm the piggy bank]], and [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]] the [[porcelain doll]] — become concerned that Andy might receive something that will replace them. To calm them, [[Sheriff Woody]], Andy's favorite toy and their ''[[de facto]]'' leader, sends [[Sarge (Toy Story)|Sarge]] and his green [[army men]] to spy on Andy's birthday party with a [[baby monitor]]. Andy receives a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure, who [[Delusion|believes he is an actual Space Ranger]] and does not know he is really a toy. Buzz impresses the others with his electronic features and becomes Andy's new favorite toy, provoking Woody's jealousy.

Two days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at a pizza restaurant called Pizza Planet. To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz, Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with [[List of Toy Story characters#RC|RC]], Andy's [[radio-controlled car]]. However, Buzz is accidentally knocked out of the window instead, and most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz. Andy takes Woody with him, but Buzz furiously confronts him in the car. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind; after a further argument, they hitch a ride to the restaurant on Pizza Planet's delivery truck.

At Pizza Planet, Buzz mistakes a [[claw crane|crane game]] full of [[List of Toy Story characters#The Aliens|rubber toy aliens]] for a rocket, and climbs in, pursued by Woody. [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Sid Phillips]], Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor, takes the two from the crane to his house, where they encounter his [[English Bull Terrier|Bull Terrier]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Scud]] and his "mutant" toys, made from parts of other toys Sid has destroyed.

Buzz witnesses a television commercial promoting him and suffers an [[existential crisis]], finally realizing he is a toy after all. He attempts to fly but falls and breaks his arm. After Sid's toys repair Buzz, Sid tapes Buzz to a firework rocket, planning to destroy him the following day. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is to make Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to come to life in front of Sid and frighten him into never harming toys again.

Now freed, Woody and Buzz pursue the Davis' [[moving truck]], but Scud attacks Woody. Buzz stays behind to fight off the dog; Woody climbs into the truck, and pushes RC out to rescue Buzz. Thinking Woody has killed another toy, the others also toss him out of the truck. When Woody and Buzz pursue the truck on RC, the other toys see them and realize their mistake. RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket strapped to Buzz. As the two are propelled into the air, Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide through the sunroof of Mrs. Davis' car, landing safely inside.

As the toys listen in on the [[Christmas]] gift opening in the new house, Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a [[List of Toy Story characters#Other|Mrs. Potato Head]]. Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be "worse" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a [[dachshund]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Buster|puppy]].
