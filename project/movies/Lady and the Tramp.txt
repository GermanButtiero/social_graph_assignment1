==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. -->
In 1909, in a small town, "Jim Dear" gives his wife "Darling"{{efn|Their real names are never revealed. They only address each other by these terms of endearment, so others - the dogs in particular - do the same.}} a [[cocker spaniel]] puppy as a Christmas present. The puppy, named Lady, grows up pampered by her doting owners, and befriends her neighbors' dogs Jock (a [[Scottish Terrier|Scottie]]) and Trusty (an elderly [[Bloodhound]]). Meanwhile, across town, a stray [[terrier]]-mix named Tramp spends his days wandering the streets, feeding on scraps and handouts, and causing trouble for the local [[dogcatcher]].

Fleeing the angry dogcatcher after freeing his friends Peg the [[Pekingese]] and Bull the [[English Bulldog|Bulldog]], Tramp finds himself in Lady's neighborhood. He overhears a distraught Lady conversing with Jock and Trusty about her owners' suddenly distant behavior towards her. When Jock and Trusty deduce this is because Darling is [[Pregnancy|pregnant]], Tramp inserts himself into the conversation as the "voice of experience", and warns Lady that "when a baby moves in, a dog moves out". Annoyed, Jock drives him from the yard. Tramp's words cause Lady to fret throughout Darling's pregnancy, but when the baby boy arrives, she is allowed to meet and bond with him, dispelling her fears.

Later, Jim Dear and Darling take a short trip, leaving the house, Lady, and the baby in the care of Jim Dear's aunt Sarah, who brings along her two [[Siamese cat]]s Si and Am.{{efn|group=|Si and Am's speech and behavior reflects derogatory stereotypes of Asian people.  In 2020, the Disney+ streaming service added a content warning for the film, noting that Lady and the Tramp “includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures” and that “these stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now.”<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54566087 "Disney updates content warning for racism in classic films,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922123338/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54566087 |date=2023-09-22 }} ''BBC News,'' October 16, 2020</ref>}} Sarah dislikes dogs, and prohibits Lady from seeing the baby; later, the cats destroy the house, and pin the deed on Lady by pretending she injured them. Sarah takes Lady to the pet shop, and has a [[muzzle (mouth guard)|muzzle]] put on her; Lady panics and flees into the street, where she is pursued by three savage dogs, until Tramp intervenes to protect her.

Tramp takes Lady to the zoo to have the muzzle removed by a [[beaver]]; he then shows Lady his owner-free lifestyle, and they explore the town. The kindly proprietor of Tony's Restaurant gives them a spaghetti dinner to share, before they end the evening with a walk in the park.
The next day, Tramp tries to convince Lady to live "footloose and collar free" with him; despite liking Tramp, she decides her duty is to watch over the baby. As Tramp escorts Lady home, he stops to chase some chickens; the dogcatcher pursues them both, but only Lady is caught. At the [[dog pound|pound]], she meets Peg, Bull, and some other strays, who all know Tramp. They reveal he has had many girlfriends in the past, and claim that females are his weakness.

Sarah comes to claim Lady, and chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away. Jock and Trusty propose that Lady should marry and come live with one of them, to escape the abuse, but she gently refuses them. When Tramp arrives to apologize to Lady, she berates him for his many girlfriends and sends him away, too. Afterwards, Lady notices a large rat sneaking into the house through the baby's bedroom window. Her attempts to alert Sarah fail, but Tramp hears her barking, returns, and enters the house himself to save the baby. Lady breaks her chain and follows soon after. Tramp is wounded in the battle with the rat, but manages to kill it behind a curtain. During the struggle, the baby's crib overturns, and he begins to cry; Sarah comes to investigate, and assumes the dogs attacked the baby.

Jim Dear and Darling return home to find that Sarah has locked Lady in the cellar and handed Tramp over to the dogcatcher to be euthanized. Disbelieving Sarah's story, Jim Dear frees Lady, who immediately shows them the dead rat. Overhearing the truth, Jock and Trusty pursue the dogcatcher's cart and try to stop it; the horses spook, causing the cart to crash. Jim Dear and Darling arrive with Lady to rescue Tramp, but Trusty is badly injured in the wreck.

Later, at Christmastime, Tramp has become an official part of the family, and he and Lady have four little puppies of their own. Jock and a mostly healed Trusty visit the family; the puppies now provide Trusty a new audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them, much to his and everyone else's amusement.
