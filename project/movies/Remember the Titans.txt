==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be 400-700 words. -->
In 1981, a group of former [[American football|football]] coaches and players attend a funeral for  a former football player.

Ten years earlier, in the summer of 1971, head coach Bill Yoast of the newly integrated [[T. C. Williams High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], is leading his white players in summer workouts. Yoast is informed that [[Herman Boone]], a black head coach originally hired to coach the city's black high school football team, has been assigned to his coaching staff instead. Then, in an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools in Alexandria are "whites only" (despite the [[Brown v. Board of Education|abolition of racial segregation in public schools]]), the school district decides to name Boone the head coach. Boone refuses, believing it is unfair to Yoast, a successful coach who is nominated to the Virginia High School Hall of Fame, but relents after seeing what it means to the black community. When Yoast tells his white players that he will accept a head-coach position elsewhere, they pledge to boycott the team if he is not their coach. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and decides to accept Boone's offer to serve as his defensive coordinator.

Boone holds his first team meeting with mostly black students in the school gymnasium but is interrupted by the arrival of Yoast and several white students. Yoast informs Boone of his decision, but Boone warns Yoast that the Titans are his team, and he will not tolerate Yoast undermining him. On August 15, the players go to [[Gettysburg College]] for [[training camp]]. Early on, the black and white team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts, especially between defensive captains Gerry Bertier (white) and Julius Campbell (Black). However, through forceful coaching, rigorous training, and a motivational early-morning run to the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] followed by an emotional speech by Boone, the team comes together and returns as a united group. Before their first game, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice and slowly gaining support from the community.

Just before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that they have arranged for the Titans to lose so that Boone will be dismissed and Yoast reinstated as head coach. During the game, the referees make several biased calls against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast marches onto the field to warn the head referee that if the game is not officiated fairly, he will expose the scandal to the press. After this, the Titans shut out their opponents and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the infuriated chairman that his actions in saving Boone's job have resulted in the loss of his Hall of Fame nomination, though the team supports him regardless. 

That night, while celebrating the victory, Gerry is severely injured in a car accident and is [[Paraplegia|paralyzed from the waist down]]. Despite the loss of the All-American linebacker, the Titans mount a comeback in the fourth quarter of the state championship and win the title.

Ten years later, after he has won the gold medal in [[shot put]] in the [[Paralympic Games]], Gerry dies in another car crash caused by a drunk driver. It is his funeral that the former football coaches and players were attending in the opening scene. Julius, whom Gerry's mother formerly disliked, is now holding her hand as he leads the team in a mournful rendition of "[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]]".

In the epilogue, descriptions show the players' and coaches' activities after the events in 1971. Coach Boone coached the Titans for five more seasons before retirement, while Coach Yoast assisted Boone for four more years, retiring from coaching in 1990; the two coaches became good friends. After Gerry's death, the gymnasium at T.C. Williams High was renamed after him. Julius would work for the city of Alexandria and remain friends with Gerry until his death.
