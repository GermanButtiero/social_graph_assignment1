PLOT: In the year of 1957, aspiring songwriter Roger Radcliffe lives in a bachelor flat near Regent's Park in London with his pet Dalmatian, Pongo. Deciding both of them need a "mate", Pongo watches women and their dogs in the street. Noticing a young woman named Anita and her Dalmatian Perdita, he drags Roger to the park to arrange a meeting. Despite a tumultuous first encounter, Roger and Anita fall in love, and soon marry, with Pongo and Perdita attending.

The Radcliffes hire a nanny and move into a small townhouse near Regent's Park. After Perdita becomes pregnant with a litter of 15 puppies, the Radcliffes are visited by Cruella de Vil, Anita's arrogant, fur-obsessed friend from their school years, who demands to know when Perdita's puppies will arrive. Distrustful of Cruella, Perdita begins to regret the idea of having puppies. When the puppies are finally born, Cruella returns demanding to buy them, but Roger firmly denies her offer, causing an outraged Cruella to swear revenge.

Several weeks later, Cruella makes good on her threat by secretly hiring Jasper and Horace Badun, two burglar brothers, to steal the puppies. With the police unable to find the puppies or prove Cruella was involved, Pongo and Perdita use the "Twilight Bark", a canine gossip line, to solicit help from the other dogs in London, and eventually all of England.

Elsewhere on the farm of a retired cavalry officer in Suffolk, the Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog, along with his feline compatriot Sergeant Tibbs, investigate a nearby mansion called Hell Hall, where puppies had been heard barking two nights earlier. In the mansion, Tibbs finds the 15 stolen Dalmatian puppies along with 84 others, who were bought legally from pet shops. After the Colonel sends word of the puppies' location back to London, Pongo and Perdita travel to Suffolk and arrive at Hell Hall, where it is revealed that Cruella intends to have the Baduns kill the puppies in order to make them into dog-skin fur coats. Pongo and Perdita battle Horace and Jasper while the Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies out of the house. Upon reuniting with their own litter of puppies, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt the other 84 puppies to protect them from Cruella and the Baduns.

The Dalmatians start their homeward trek, pursued by Cruella and the Baduns. They eventually make their way to Dinsford, where they meet an overweight Black Labrador who offers them a ride in a moving van bound for London. Cruella and the Baduns arrive, prompting Pongo to have his entire family roll in a sooty fireplace to disguise themselves as other Labradors. While the Dalmatians board the van, their cover is blown when melting snow causes some of their soot to be washed off. Enraged, Cruella pursues the van in her car and tries to ram it off the road, but the Baduns, attempting to do the same with their lorry, end up colliding with her. Both vehicles crash into a snowy ditch as the van drives away.

In London, a depressed Nanny and the Radcliffes try to enjoy Christmas and the wealth they have acquired from a song that Roger had written about Cruella, which has become a big radio hit. The Dalmatians suddenly flood the house, reuniting with their owners. Upon counting the massive family of dogs, Roger chooses to use his songwriting royalties to buy a big house in the country so they can keep all 101 Dalmatians.
