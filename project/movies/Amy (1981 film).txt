== Plot ==
In 1913, Amy Medford leaves her possessive, wealthy husband to begin a new life teaching speech to deaf students in the rural [[Appalachian Mountains]] at a school for [[Blindness and education|blind]] and [[Deaf education|deaf]] children. Though encountering resistance from those who question whether it's even possible to teach speech to children with hearing impairments, Amy becomes close to the staff and children, building a new life for herself and gaining the personal strength she will need to stand up to the domineering husband who is not content to let her live her own life.
