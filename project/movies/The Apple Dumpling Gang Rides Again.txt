PLOT: Amos Tucker and Theodore Ogelvie, a pair of bumbling holdup men now going straight, arrive in the "boom town" of Junction City to start anew. The duo end up causing havoc while getting cheated out of their money by bank robbers Wes Hardin and Hank Starrett. Things worsen when Amos and Theodore end up suspected of the robbery and on the run from the town's feared lawman Marshal Woolly Bill Hitchcock, who developed a personal vendetta toward Amos and Theodore after they accidentally humiliated and injured him on two occasions. To escape Hitchcock's vengeance, Amos and Theodore ditch their donkey Clarise, as she was used by the robbers, and enlist in the United States Cavalry at Fort Concho. The duo's bunglings and a run-in with a now insane marshal, who found them by following Clarise, result in the fort being burned to the ground. 

The following day, the fort's commander, Major Gaskill, is relieved of his position while Amos and Theodore are placed in a military jail. The jail turns out to be a cover for robber baron Big Mac, who proceeds to recruit Amos and Theodore for an upcoming train robbery. Still determined to go straight, the boys attempt to extricate themselves from the situation by warning the local sheriff. The sheriff not available, they are told to visit the saloon as there is a visiting U.S. Marshall. After dressing up as bar-room dance girls to hide themselves from Big Mac's gang, having another encounter with Hitchcock, and making a trade for blankets to hide themselves, Amos and Theodore accidentally end up on the train Big Mac is targeting. With the help of Jeff Reed, an army intelligence officer who posed as an enlisted soldier to uncover a conspiracy of military robberies, and Major Gaskill's daughter Millie, they arrest the robbers and their inside man Lt. Jim Ravencroft. Soon after being given pardons, Amos and Theodore decide to resume working at Russell Donovan's farm.
