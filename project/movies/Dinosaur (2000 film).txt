==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
A ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' attacks a herd of dinosaurs, and destroys an ''[[Iguanodon]]'' nest. One surviving ''Iguanodon'' egg is stolen by an ''[[Oviraptor]],'' journeying to a tropical island inhabited by [[Lemuriformes|prehistoric lemurs]]. Plio, the daughter of lemur patriarch Yar, names the newly-hatched baby Aladar and raises him alongside her daughter Suri, despite Yar's initial objections.

Several years later, an adult Aladar watches the lemurs take part in a mating ritual, where Plio's teenage brother Zini fails to attract a mate. Moments after the ritual ends, a colossal [[meteorite]] crashes into the [[sea]], creating explosive shockwaves that destroy the island. Aladar and Yar's family flee and swim to the mainland, mourning for the loss of all lemurs before moving inland.

While crossing a burnt desert, the group is attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptor]]''. They escape them by joining a multi-species herd of dinosaur refugees heading to the Nesting Grounds; a sanctuary left undevastated by the destruction of the meteor. The herd's callous leader, ''Iguanodon'' Kron, forces the family to the back of the line, where they befriend a trio of elderly dinosaurs; ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' Eema, her pet ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' Url, and her friend Baylene, a ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''. 

The herd travel for days to the site of a lake, only to find it seemingly dried up. Determined to reach the Nesting Grounds, Kron orders the herd to move on, and let the weakest perish. Aladar, realizing water is buried under the dried lake, digs with Baylene until they reach the [[water table]], saving the herd from [[dehydration]]. Kron's sister Neera, impressed by Aladar's compassion, begins to grow closer to him. Kron sees Aladar's increasing popularity as a threat to his dominance.

Meanwhile, a pair of ''Carnotaurus'' are tracking the herd, ambushing a scouting party led by Kron's lieutenant Bruton, who escapes with severe wounds to warn the others of the approaching predators. Kron has the herd deliberately abandon Aladar, the lemurs, the elderly dinosaurs, and Bruton, hoping they will slow the pursuers down. The group takes shelter in a cave during a rainstorm, with the ''Carnotaurus'' finding and attacking them during the night. Bruton sacrifices himself to cause a cave-in that kills one of the ''Carnotaurus'', forcing the other to retreat.

Venturing deeper into the cave, the group reaches a dead end, causing Aladar to briefly lose hope. Baylene reproaches him for giving up, and uses her strength to smash through the wall, revealing the lush Nesting Grounds on the other side. As the group briefly celebrates, Eema notices that a landslide has collapsed the usual entrance into the valley. Aladar rushes to warn Kron, who is attempting to force the herd to climb the rubble, unaware of the sheer drop on the other side. Kron sees the warning as a challenge for the position of herd leader and fights Aladar, until Neera intervenes. Fed up with Kron's cruelty, she and the herd leave with Aladar, while Kron stays behind to climb the rubble in an attempt to prove that Aladar's warning is false.

The surviving ''Carnotaurus'' arrives and charges at the herd. Aladar rallies them into a group and outnumbers the ''Carnotaurus''; it decides to go after the isolated Kron instead. Aladar and Neera rush to his aid, as Kron is mortally wounded. Aladar pushes the ''Carnotaurus'' towards the edge of the drop, where the ground gives way, causing the ''Carnotaurus'' to fall to its death. Aladar and Neera mourn for Kron's demise, and lead the herd to the Nesting Grounds. Some time later, a new generation of dinosaurs hatches, among them Aladar and Neera's children. The lemurs find more of their own kind, together embracing their new home.
