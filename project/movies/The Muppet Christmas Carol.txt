PLOT: Charles Dickens (Gonzo) and his friend Rizzo narrate the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy, rude, penny-pinching and lonely moneylender of nineteenth century London, who does not share the merriment of Christmas. On Christmas Eve, he rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen (Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker) collecting money for charity, and hurls a wreath at a carol-singing Bean Bunny. His kind, humble employee Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog) and the other bookkeepers request to not work on Christmas Day, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. That night, Scrooge encounters the shackled ghosts of his late business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf), in his bed chambers. They warn him to repent of his wicked ways, or be condemned to wearing chains and to suffer in the afterlife as they do. They also say three spirits will visit him during the night.

At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past, who shows him visions of his childhood and early adult life. Along with Dickens and Rizzo, they visit his lonely school days and then his time as an employee at Fozziwig's (Fozzie Bear) rubber chicken factory. There, at Fozziwig's Christmas party, Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love but loses as he chooses money over her. A despondent Scrooge tells the Ghost to leave him and is returned to his home.

Scrooge next meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred's house, where Scrooge is made fun of for his stinginess and general ill will toward all. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with the little they have. Scrooge also takes pity on Bob's ill son Tiny Tim (Robin the Frog), whom the Ghost comments will soon die if things continue the way they are. 

The Ghost leaves Scrooge to the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who takes Scrooge into the future where a recent death elicits no sympathy from the inhabitants of London, and the stolen possessions of the deceased are sold to a fence named Old Joe. The Ghost also shows Scrooge the Cratchits' home, where they find Bob and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. Scrooge is led to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out the neglected grave of the unloved man; Scrooge wipes the snow away on the tombstone to see that it bears his name. Scrooge tearfully vows to change his ways and suddenly finds himself back in his bedroom, where he discovers it is Christmas Day.

An overjoyed Scrooge begins spreading happiness and joy around London, agreeing to give money to the gentlemen's charity and reconciling with Fred and Fozziwig. Scrooge tells Bean to buy the poulterer's prized turkey, and they, along with Dickens, Rizzo, and the gentlemen, deliver it to Bob's family. Scrooge announces to Bob that he will raise his salary and pay off his mortgage, Dickens tells that Tiny Tim escaped death thanks to Scrooge's new generosity, and everyone celebrates Christmas together.
