PLOT: At Medfield College, science enthusiast Dexter Riley and his friends, including Richard Schuyler and Debbie Dawson, secretly listen to a board meeting, where Dean Higgins discusses the college's precarious finances. Later, Professor Lufkin shows Higgins the science lab, where Dexter is conducting an invisibility experiment. That night, a thunderstorm strikes the lab, damaging Dexter's equipment. The next day, Dexter discovers that his experimental formula has rendered part of his glasses invisible. Further tests reveal that the substance causes temporary invisibility and can be rinsed off with water.

Higgins introduces a surprise visitor: A.J. Arno, a recently released criminal who now owns the college's mortgage. Two years prior, Dexter had helped expose Arno’s gambling scheme. Suspicious of Arno’s true intentions, Dexter and Schuyler use the invisibility formula to sneak into his office. There, they find documents proving that gambling is legal on college land due to a 1912 statute, and that Arno plans to turn Medfield into a gambling town.

Dexter shows their findings to Lufkin and Higgins. Dexter proposes entering the upcoming Forsythe science contest with his invisibility formula to win prize money, but Higgins dismisses the idea, preferring to focus on Druffle’s bumblebee study. But Medfield has actually been dropped from the contest. Hoping to get them reinstated, Higgins meets contest sponsor Timothy Forsythe for golf. To help, Dexter hides while invisible and manipulates Higgins’ shots, astonishing everyone with a series of hole-in-ones. Impressed, Forsythe agrees to let Medfield reenter the contest.

However, Arno spots Dexter becoming visible in the showers and grows suspicious. When Higgins is invited to play in a pro golf tournament, he accepts, believing he can win enough to save the college. Dexter misses the plane and watches helplessly as Higgins’ performance without help is a disaster. Arno watches too, puzzled by the inconsistencies.

Back on campus, Higgins and Lufkin place their hopes on Druffle’s experiment, but have to change plans when Druffle ends up heavily bandaged after a bee attack. Lufkin suggests giving Dexter’s invisibility formula a chance, and Higgins reluctantly agrees.

That night, Arno's chauffeur Cookie, disguised as a janitor, spies on Dexter and Schuyler using the formula and later steals it. During the demonstration to Forsythe, Dexter unknowingly uses the switched, ineffective spray. Embarrassed, the students lose their shot at winning the prize. Later, Dexter learns from a janitor that there is no night staff, confirming Cookie’s theft. He plants a walkie-talkie in Arno’s office and Schuyler hears plans for an invisible bank heist.

Schuyler goes to the police while Dexter warns the bank president, but both are dismissed. When the invisible Arno and Cookie carry out the heist, Dexter tries to douse them with water but fails. A chaotic car chase ensues, ending when Dexter and his friends force Arno’s invisible car into a swimming pool, rendering the car, Arno, Cookie, and the money visible. The criminals are arrested.

The friends retrieve the invisibility spray from the pool and rush to the Forsythe Award ceremony to plead for another chance. When the demonstration again fails, Higgins declares invisibility doesn’t exist—just as his upper body turns invisible, shocking the crowd. Medfield wins the $50,000 prize to save the school for another year.
