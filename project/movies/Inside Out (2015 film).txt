==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->
In the mind of a young girl named Riley Andersen are five personified emotions that influence her actions: [[Joy (Inside Out)|Joy]], [[Sadness (Inside Out)|Sadness]], [[Fear (Inside Out)|Fear]], [[Disgust (Inside Out)|Disgust]], and [[Anger (Inside Out)|Anger]]. Riley's experiences become [[memory|memories]] that are stored as colored orbs and are sent into [[long-term memory]] each night. The aspects of the five most important "core memories" within her personality take the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader and tries to limit Sadness's influence, perceiving her as an unnecessary burden for Riley. 

At age 11, Riley moves from [[Minnesota]] to <!--Do not link per MOS:OL-->San Francisco<!--Do not link per MOS:OL--> for her father's new job. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively saddens joyous memories, causing Riley to cry in front of her class. This creates Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of the memory using a [[pneumatic tube]] but knocks loose the other core memories during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters.

In the absence of Joy and Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust try to make happy core memories, but the results are disastrous, distancing Riley from her parents, peers, and hobbies. Without the core memories, Anger causes Riley's personality islands to crumble and fall into the "Memory Dump", where things fade to non-existence as they are forgotten.

While navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood [[imaginary friend]], who suggests riding the "[[train of thought]]" back to Headquarters. Meanwhile, Anger, intending to restore Riley's happiness, convinces Disgust and Fear that Riley should run away to Minnesota, where her happy memories were formed. Joy, Sadness, and Bing Bong catch the train, but it is derailed when another island collapses. Joy tries to ride a "recall tube" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, sending her and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump. 

Joy discovers a sad memory of Riley losing a [[Ice hockey|hockey]] game that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her, and she realizes Sadness's purpose in alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use his song-fueled wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to ascend due to their combined weight. In the final run, Bing Bong manages to sacrifice himself to save Joy in the memory dump by jumping out of the wagon before fading away.
 
Anger's idea shorts out the console, putting Riley into [[Depression (mood)|depression]] as she boards a bus to Minnesota. Joy reunites with Sadness, and they return to Headquarters. Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, much to the others' shock and confusion. Sadness successfully removes the idea bulb from the console, restarting it and prompting Riley to get off the bus and rush home. Joy, realizing that Riley needs to tell her parents the truth, hands Sadness the core memories, allowing her to make them sad. Riley bursts into tears, telling her parents she misses her old life. Riley's parents comfort her and tell her they also miss Minnesota.

Sadness brings Joy over to have her join hands on the console, creating a new core memory that is both happy and sad, and a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her life in San Francisco. A year later, a 12-year-old Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and acquired new hobbies. Inside Headquarters, Riley's emotions admire her new personality islands, powered by new multicolored core memories that contain a mixture of emotions, and are given an expanded console that has enough room for them to work as a team. Although they admit slight concern over a red alarm light marked [[puberty]], they decide that it is not important at the moment.
