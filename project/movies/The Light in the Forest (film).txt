==Plot==
In 1764 Pennsylvania, a young white boy raised by Native Americans and given the name True-son, is forced to return to white society following the signing of a peace treaty.

True-son (whose birth name was Johnny) not wanting to leave his adoptive Indian family, tries to kill himself by eating a poisonous plant on the march back to his white family. Del (Fess Parker) stops him.

True-son's Indian cousin joins him on the way to bring him gifts and messages from his Indian father. After True-son/Johnny's Indian cousin goes as far as he is allowed to go, Johnny's biological father comes to take him home. Del goes along to help, due to Johnny's resistance.

He struggles to adjust to his white family and the towns people. One man in particular, his uncle Wilsey Owens, makes it especially hard for Johnny, and treats him like a "dirty Indian".

A girl in the employ of the Wilsey Owen's family, Shenandoe, was orphaned when her whole family was killed/scalped by the Indians. She is obviously afraid of Native Americans and Johnny, but soon comes to realize they have many things in common and learns to love Johnny. Wilsey is jealous of Johnny and Shenandoe's affection for each other as he has eyes for her himself.

As Shenandoe and Johnny were confessing their love for each other and kissed for the first time, Johnny's Indian cousin and another Indian friend comes to find him. Uncle Wilsey shoots the Indian friend. Johnny and his cousin hit Wilsey and knock him out to keep him from killing Johnny's cousin as well. His cousin suggests scalping Wilsey, but Johnny stops him.

Johnny and his cousin run away together, back to his Indian family. The brother of the Indian who was killed by Wilsey wants revenge, 20 white scalps. They kill and scalp 15, including children, which upsets Johnny. They attempt to get 5 more scalps but Johnny warns the white people there is an ambush ahead, incurring the wrath of his Indian family. His whole Indian tribe, including his cousin, votes to kill Johnny, but his Indian father stands up for him. Afterward though his Indian father says that he is no longer his son, nor he his father and that he needs to go back to his white family.

Johnny goes back to his family with Del who has come to find him. Del and Johnny accuse Wilsey of killing the Indian needlessly which caused the Indians to scalp the white settlers. Wilsey is angry starts a fight with Del, but Johnny said the fight is his as it was his Indian friend. Johnny, who didn't know how to fist fight, was instructed by Del in his Indian language so that Wilsey could not understand. Del and Shenandoe told Johnny to hit Wilsey once for them as well. Johnny won the fight and Uncle Wilsey extended his hand. Johnny shook his hand and then he and Shenandoe ran off hand in hand.
