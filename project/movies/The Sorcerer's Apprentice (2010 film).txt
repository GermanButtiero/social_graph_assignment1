PLOT: In 740 AD in England, Merlin has three apprentices: Balthazar Blake, Veronica Gorloisen, and Maxim Horvath. Horvath betrays Merlin by allying with Morgana le Fay, an evil sorceress trying to steal a spell called "The Rising," which will revive dead sorcerers and enslave mankind. Morgana mortally wounds Merlin, but Veronica absorbs Morgana's soul. As Morgana tries to kill Veronica from within, Balthazar stops her by imprisoning both in the "Grimhold", a magical nesting doll. Before dying, Merlin gives Balthazar a dragon figurine to identify the Prime Merlinean, his descendant who can defeat Morgana. Throughout history, Balthazar searches for Merlin's heir and confines Morganians, sorcerers who tried to free Morgana, including Horvath, in the Grimhold.

In 2000, 10-year-old Dave Stutler meets Balthazar in his Manhattan antique store. Balthazar gives him Merlin's dragon figurine, which transforms into a ring, revealing Dave as the Prime Merlinean. When Balthazar retrieves a book on magic, Dave accidentally opens the Grimhold, releasing Horvath. Balthazar and Horvath fight for the Grimhold and are imprisoned in an ancient Chinese urn under a ten-year curse while Dave escapes with the ring.

Ten years later, Dave is a physics student at NYU. The ten-year imprisonment curse of the urn ends, releasing both Horvath and Balthazar. Horvath pursues Dave and the Grimhold. Balthazar rescues Dave, riding an animated steel eagle adapted from a Chrysler Building gargoyle. Dave refuses to help Balthazar, having been under psychiatric care since their first meeting, until Balthazar agrees to leave after finding the Grimhold. They track the Grimhold to Chinatown, where Horvath has released the next Morganian, Sun Lok. Dave defeats Sun Lok, and Balthazar retrieves the Grimhold. Dave changes his mind and agrees to become Balthazar's apprentice. He also becomes romantically involved with his childhood crush, Becky, against Balthazar's wishes and advice.

To get back the Grimhold, Horvath enlists the help of Drake Stone, a celebrity magician who is also a Morganian. They attempt to kill Dave, but Balthazar saves him. Cued by Horvath, Dave demands to know the truth about Balthazar's quest. Balthazar reveals that Morgana is trapped in the Grimhold with Veronica. As the Prime Merlinian, Dave is the only one who can stop her.

Despite Balthazar's disdain for his relationship with Becky, Dave convinces him to allow him to meet her for a date. Dave tries to use magic to clean his lab but loses control of his animated cleaning mops, which forces him to cancel his date with Becky. He is saved because of Balthazar's intervention and gives up on magic until Becky unknowingly changes his mind. He returns to his lab just as Drake and Horvath steal the Grimhold; Horvath betrays Drake by stealing his magic.

Horvath releases the witch Abigail Williams, using her to kidnap Becky at the radio station, and then steals her magic. He threatens to kill Becky, forcing Dave to surrender his ring. Without the ring, Dave has no conduit to use his magic, so Balthazar goes after Horvath in Battery Park. Horvath releases Morgana, still trapped inside Veronica's body, and slowly begins the Rising Spell. As Horvath animates the Charging Bull sculpture and commands it to attack Balthazar, Dave arrives and stuns Horvath with a Tesla coil tied to Balthazar's car while Balthazar's eagle flies away with the bull. Becky disrupts the Rising Spell, stunning Morgana.

Balthazar takes Morgana, body and soul, from Veronica into himself, but Morgana escapes and tries to incinerate them. Dave succeeds in stopping her without his ring. Morgana overwhelms Balthazar and kills him when he intercepts a bolt meant for Veronica. Dave makes another, larger Tesla coil out of the square's lamp posts and power lines to stun her and then fires a plasma barrage, finally destroying her. He revives Balthazar by restarting his heart with plasma shocks, and Balthazar reunites with Veronica. Dave and Becky fly to France for breakfast on Balthazar's eagle.
