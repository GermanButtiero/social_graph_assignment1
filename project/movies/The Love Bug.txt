PLOT: thumb|200px|right|Dean Jones in ''The Love Bug''
Jim Douglas is a once-prominent race car driver now relegated to participating in demolition derbies. Residing in a converted firehouse overlooking San Francisco Bay, Jim shares his abode with Tennessee Steinmetz, an eccentric mechanic and sculptor whose artistic creations repurpose discarded automobile components.

Jim’s fortunes shift when he visits a European car dealership, where he encounters Carole Bennett, a mechanic and sales associate, as well as Peter Thorndyke, the British proprietor of the establishment. During this visit, Jim notices a peculiar Volkswagen Beetle—a vehicle Thorndyke openly abuses after it is returned to the showroom under mysterious circumstances. Lacking the financial means to procure a vehicle, Jim departs, only to find that the Beetle follows him home. This acquisition leads to a police intervention on charges of grand theft, forcing Jim to reluctantly agree to a lease-purchase arrangement for the car.

Initially, Jim is disenchanted with the Beetle, whose idiosyncratic behavior includes avoiding highways and orchestrating encounters with Carole. Suspecting Thorndyke of duping him with a malfunctioning vehicle, Jim remains skeptical until Tennessee discerns the truth: the car possesses sentience. Endearing himself to the Beetle, Tennessee christens the car "Herbie".

Jim and Herbie venture into the competitive world of racing. In their debut race, Herbie delivers an unexpected victory, much to Thorndyke's dismay and Carole's delight. Forced to compete directly with Thorndyke at Riverside, Herbie scores another impressive victory, even edging his rival to the finish line. So Jim, Tennessee, and Herbie become the talk of the California racing circuit, while Thorndyke suffers increasingly humiliating defeats. Desperate to discover the secret of Herbie's success, Thorndyke, on the eve of another important race, convinces Carole to take Jim for a ride in the best car in the showroom, then sneaks into his rival's house, gets Tennessee drunk on his own Irish coffee, and thus manages to undermine Herbie's performance in the race itself. Disillusioned, Jim decides to replace Herbie with a new Lamborghini, a decision that alienates Carole who had just quit her promising job alongside Thorndyke, and Tennessee.

Feeling betrayed, Herbie reacts by vandalizing the Lamborghini and fleeing. After narrowly escaping being torn apart in Thorndyke's workshop, his escapades culminate in an attempt to leap from the Golden Gate Bridge, prompting Jim to intervene and reconcile with him. At the police station, Tang Wu, a racing enthusiast and local businessman whose property Herbie inadvertently damaged, agrees to an offer from Jim to drop charges in exchange for ownership of Herbie on condition that Jim and Tennessee may race Herbie in the prestigious El Dorado Road race, with the agreement that if Jim wins the race, Mr. Wu will sell Herbie back to him for one dollar. 

The El Dorado race, a two-day event traversing the Sierra Nevada, becomes the stage for Thorndyke's underhanded tactics. Despite these obstacles, Jim, Carole, and Tennessee persevere, although the first leg of the race leaves Herbie in a battered state, limping across the finish line using a makeshift wagon wheel. Overnight, Jim can't start Herbie's engine and admits to Mr. Wu that Herbie is in no condition to continue the race. Thorndyke suddenly appears, revealing that he made a separate bet with Mr. Wu that should Herbie drop out of the race, Thorndyke would take possession of Herbie and have him crushed. As Thorndyke prepares to take the car away, Herbie comes back to life, throwing Thorndyke out.

On the final leg, Herbie overcomes numerous challenges to regain his position. As they near the finish line, Herbie splits in two due to mechanical strain caused by Thorndyke's sabotages and Jim's wild driving. His rear half, carrying Tennessee and the engine, crosses the finish line first, while his front half, with Jim and Carole aboard, follows closely, securing both first and third place.

In the aftermath, Wu assumes control of Thorndyke's dealership, appoints Tennessee as his assistant, and relegates Thorndyke to the mechanics' workshop alongside his accomplice Havershaw. Restored to his former glory, Herbie serves as the vehicle for Jim and Carole's departure, whisking the newlyweds away on their honeymoon.
