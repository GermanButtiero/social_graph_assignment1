==Plot==
Max Keeble is a 12-year-old paperboy who starts his first day of seventh grade at the fictional John J. Curtis High School at the beginning of the film. He is antagonized by the greedy and tyrannical principal at his school, Elliot T. Jindrake; bullies Troy McGinty and Dobbs; and the Evil Ice Cream Man. Max also learns that an animal shelter he visits next to the school is being closed to build Jindrake's opulent football stadium. One day, Max's father reveals that because of his job, he and the family will be relocating to [[Chicago]] for his boss, because he is unable to stand up for himself. Max realizes that he is free to do whatever he wants to his tormentors, facing no consequences because he will be gone by then.

Enlisting his best friends, Megan and Robe, Max sets up a variety of pranks throughout the film. These include traumatizing Troy by playing the main theme song of the fictional children's television show ''MacGoogles the Highlander Frog'' (which frightened him as a child), then trapping him in the gym with someone wearing a MacGoogles costume; instigating a fight between Dobbs and the Evil Ice Cream Man by stealing the coolant coil for his ice cream truck and Dobbs' handheld device; and ruining Jindrake's chances of becoming successor to the superintendent, Bobby "Crazy Legs" Knebworth (an alumnus who was a star football player for the school) by planting animal pheromones within his breath spray, instigating a food fight in the cafeteria in view of Knebworth, and later by sabotaging his TV announcements by placing a cardboard cutout of Max mocking him.

After Max's missions are completed, Jindrake, Troy and Dobbs somehow find out that he was behind all the pranks he pulled off. Later, Max ends up ditching Megan and Robe's going-away party by accepting an invitation to a milkshake party hosted by his love interest, Jenna, causing a falling-out. Robe tells Max how Megan really feels about him, and then walks away telling Max that he hopes he enjoys his new life in Chicago. Max then calls Megan's house, telling her mother to relay to her that he is sorry for what happened. Taking Max's earlier advice to heart, his father announces that he quit his job and will start his own business, meaning that Max is not moving after all. Max freaks out at this news, and learns that other students at his school are suffering because of his actions.

Max confronts Jindrake, Troy, and Dobbs one final time at the end of the film. With the help of his schoolmates, Max throws Troy and Dobbs into the dumpster and squares off Jindrake from demolishing the animal shelter. Jindrake is fired from his job and faces serious criminal charges for manipulating the school budget in order to build his stadium after Max tricked him into publicly admitting to his crimes earlier. Max is just happy that the first week of school was over, even if it meant still having to deal with the Evil Ice Cream Man after ruining his van and business.
