== Plot ==
The story of ''Jagga Jasoos'' revolves around the high-profile case of [[Purulia arms drop case|Purulia Arms Drop]], which took place in 1995 allegedly to overthrow the then Communist Government of West Bengal, India. Jagga, a curious and shy young boy in a quaint little town lives a happy life with his accident-prone adoptive father, Badal Bagchi. Jagga, being self-conscious of his stammer, doesn't speak much. One day, Bagchi teaches him to "speak" in song. Sometime later, after admitting Jagga into a boarding school, Bagchi suddenly disappears. Feeling abandoned, Jagga's only contact with Bagchi is a VHS tape that he receives in the mail every year on his birthday. Armed with sharp detective skills, Jagga sets out to solve the mystery of his missing parent. Along the way, he finds a partner Shruti Sengupta, an accident-prone journalist with her own international criminal case to solve. Using a few tricks he learnt from Bagchi, Jagga, along with Shruti, embarks on a mission to uncover the details of his father's mysterious secret life and finds himself embroiled in a worldwide smuggling racket. The film later ends on a cliffhanger as it shows Jagga and his father on a cruise ship having been captured by the Two-Headed Bashir Alexander.
