==Plot==
Two years after the events of the [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua|first film]], newly married couple Papi ([[George Lopez]]) and Chloe ([[Odette Yustman]])<ref name="IMDb">{{cite web|title=Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1482393/|publisher=IMDb|access-date=18 January 2011}}</ref> are trying to keep up 4 months later with their five puppies Papi Jr, Lala, Rosa, Ali and Pep (voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]], [[Madison Pettis]], Chantilly Spalan, Delaney Jones and [[Emily Osment]]) running around the house, creating problem after problem. However, Papi shows a soft side for the pups and occasionally tells them of their ancient ancestors, the Chihuahua Warriors. Aunt Viv ([[Susan Blakely]]), Chloe's owner, is in the [[rain forest]] for the next 6 months with her niece, Rachel ([[Erin Cahill]]) searching for plants for [[medical research]]. During this time Sam ([[Marcus Coloma]]), Papi's owner and Rachel's boyfriend, is caring for the whole chihuahua family. Sam takes Chloe, Papi and the puppies back home to meet his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Cortez ([[Castulo Guerra]] and [[Lupe Ontiveros]]).

Sam finds out that his parents are struggling to pay the mortgage on their house and the bank plans to [[Foreclosure |take their home and sell it]]. Chloe and the rest of the dogs decide to compete in a [[Conformation show|dog show]] in order to win a large [[cash]] prize. Delgado, an old friend, also comes to the home and tells Chloe that he needs her help with a secret mission. The mission turns out to be Delgado trying to tell his two sons the truth about why he left them as puppies, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Later, Papi initially wins the dog show, but is later disqualified due to a lack of [[Breed registry | breeding certification]], losing to an arrogant and vain French [[poodle]] named Appoline ([[Bridgit Mendler]]). After hearing that Delgado has sons in [[Los Angeles]], the puppies set off to find them. In trying to help, the puppies get caught up in a bank robbery.

Meanwhile, Chloe, Papi, Pedro (Papi's adoptive brother) and Delgado are trying to find the puppies when they appear running across the [[television]] screen at the site of the bank robbery. They run to the bank to begin searching for the puppies. The puppies happen to crawl into the crooks' [[duffel bag]]s and end up at 
the Hoffman Bread Factory. Pedro finds a mask with the scent of bread on it which leads them to the factory. They foil the robbery, then return home to find that they have been awarded more than enough money to save their house and that Rachel and Aunt Viv have returned. Delgado also goes back into the police force with his two sons, now that they found out the truth on why Delgado left them as puppies. Rachel accepts Sam's marriage proposal and the family celebrates.
