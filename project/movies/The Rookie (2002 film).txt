==Plot==
[[Jim Morris]] is the son of a career Navy man who moves the family from [[Hollywood, Florida]], to [[Big Lake, Texas]]. Jim is a skilled pitcher, though his father disapproves of his dream of making it to [[Major League Baseball]]. The town to which Jim's family moved, Big Lake, has lost its love for baseball, preferring football. Thus, he is unable to play baseball in high school. He later gets a chance when he is drafted by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], but he tears up his shoulder, ending his lifelong dream.

In 1999, Jim, married with three children, is a high school science teacher and head baseball coach. His team, the Big Lake Owls, is unsuccessful, with many of his players being skilled but unmotivated. One day after practice, the team catcher offers to play catch with Jim. There, it is revealed that Jim may still have his [[fastball]]. The Owls believe that Jim could possibly pitch in the major leagues and offer him a deal: if the Owls win district and make the state playoffs, Jim will try out again. He accepts their offer, and the team urges him to throw his fastball in batting practice; this immensely improves their batting skills.

The Owls win district. Jim is told of a tryout nearby for the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] and decides to attend without telling his wife Lorri, afraid that her fear of him re-injuring his shoulder will keep him from going. The professional [[scout (sport)|scouts]] discover his ability to throw a baseball at {{convert|98|mph|abbr=on}}. The lead scout tells Jim he could be signed to a minor-league deal. Lorri finds out after getting two phone messages from the Tampa Bay scouts. Jim tells his father - with whom he still has a cold relationship - who again tries to dissuade him. Lorri is also reluctant to let Jim go, citing his home responsibilities, but after seeing how Jim is inspiring their son, Hunter, she allows him to go.

Jim is initially assigned to the minor league [[Class AA]] [[Montgomery Biscuits|Orlando Rays]] but quickly moves up to the [[Class AAA]] [[Durham Bulls]]. Concerned for his family due to mounting bills, he decides to give up, but Lorri talks him out of it. Jim gets inspired again when he views his own interview on television and watches a [[Little League Baseball]] game, remembering the love for baseball he had as a kid.

In September, Jim is told that the Major League club has called him up and they will be playing in Texas against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]]. He calls his wife, who informs the town. Having told her of the dress code for players, Jim finds his sports coat, a necktie, and his [[Rita of Cascia|St. Rita]] (the saint of impossible dreams) medal hanging in his locker when he arrives. His family, high school players, and many townspeople go to the game. Jim impresses many of the coaches in warm-ups with his fastball, and late in the game, with Tampa Bay losing badly, Jim is called in to pitch to [[Royce Clayton]] and end the inning. Jim gets a [[strikeout]] against Clayton on three straight fastballs. After the game, he gets interviewed by the press and notices that his father has come to the game. Jim's father admits how special it is to see his son play in the majors and apologizes for not supporting Jim before. Jim thanks him and gives him the ball with which he got the strikeout, and the two repair their relationship.

The Big Lake High School trophy case displays Jim's major league jersey. It is then mentioned that Jim pitched in the major leagues for two seasons before retiring and returning to teaching in Texas.
