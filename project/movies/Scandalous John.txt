==Plot==
John McCanless is a rip-snorting, 79-year-old western rancher, together with the prettiest granddaughter; ugliest horse; scrawniest herd; and puniest partner, a Mexican handyman, go on a cattle drive (of one cow) and do battle against a wealthy, land-grabbing industrialist. After an adventurous (and humorous) trek, à la Don Quixote, the rancher confronts the villain in a shootout that parallels the classic struggle of good and evil in the Old West.
