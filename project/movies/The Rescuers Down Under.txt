PLOT: In the Outback, a young boy named Cody rescues and befriends Marahute, a rare golden eagle, who shows Cody her nest and eggs and gives him one of her feathers. Cody later falls into an animal trap set by Percival C. McLeach, a local poacher who killed Marahute's mate and is wanted by the Australian Rangers, while rescuing a mouse who was the bait in the trap. Realizing Cody has Marahute's feather and must know her location, McLeach kidnaps the boy and throws his backpack to a float of crocodiles to fake his death to the Rangers.

The rescued mouse hurries to an RAS outpost shortly after Cody's capture to inform the operator of the kidnapping, from which a telegram is sent to the Rescue Aid Society headquarters in New York City. Bernard and Miss Bianca, the RAS's elite field agents, are assigned, interrupting Bernard's attempts to propose marriage to Bianca. They go to find Orville the albatross, who aided them before, but discover he is no longer in service and his brother Wilbur has taken over for him. Despite the harsh winter conditions, he agrees to fly them to Australia when he learns of Cody's abduction. There, they meet Jake, a hopping mouse who is the RAS's local regional operative. Jake becomes infatuated with Bianca and flirts with her, much to Bernard's dismay. He serves as their "tour guide" and protector in search of Cody. Wilbur accidentally bends his spinal column out of shape trying to help them, so Jake sends him to the hospital (an old ambulance). Wilbur refuses to undergo surgery (due to the doctor planning to use dangerous tools), but his back is straightened as he fights to escape the medical mice. He flies away in search of his friends.

At McLeach's hideout, Cody refuses to divulge Marahute's whereabouts. Realizing that protecting Marahute's eggs is Cody's weak spot, McLeach tricks Cody into thinking someone else killed Marahute and releases him, knowing that Cody will go to her nest. Cody does so and McLeach soon captures Marahute along with Cody, Jake, and Bianca. Bernard manages to hide Marahute's eggs from McLeach's pet goanna, Joanna. Wilbur catches up to Bernard, who orders him to watch the eggs, much to his dismay.

McLeach takes his captives to Crocodile Falls, a huge waterfall at the end of the river he threw Cody's backpack into. He ties Cody up and hangs him over the float of crocodiles, intent on feeding Cody to them to eliminate him as a witness. Bernard, riding a razorback pig he tamed using a horse whispering technique he learned from Jake, arrives and disables McLeach's vehicle before he can succeed. McLeach then attempts to shoot the rope holding Cody above the water, but Bernard tricks Joanna into crashing into McLeach, sending both of them into the water. The crocodiles turn their attention to McLeach and Joanna; behind them, Cody falls into the water as the damaged rope breaks. As Joanna flees to the bank, McLeach fends off and taunts the crocodiles, forgetting about the waterfall until it is too late; he desperately attempts to swim to shore, but is washed over the waterfall to his death. Bernard dives into the water and holds Cody long enough for Jake and Bianca to free Marahute, allowing the eagle to save Cody and Bernard just as they go over the waterfall.

Bernard, desperate to prevent any further interruptions, finally proposes to Bianca, which she immediately accepts, after which Jake salutes him with new-found respect. Safe at last, the group departs for Cody's home. Meanwhile, Wilbur is still protecting Marahute's eggs; they hatch, and one of the eaglets bites him, to his dismay.
