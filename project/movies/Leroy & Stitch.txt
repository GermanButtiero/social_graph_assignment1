PLOT: With their mission to capture and repurpose Jumba's experiments completed, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley are honored as heroes by the Galactic Alliance. Jumba is offered to return to his old laboratory, Pleakley is offered a post as chairman of Earth Studies at Galactic Alliance Community College, Stitch is made the Captain of the Galactic Armada and commander of the Big Red Battleship 9000 (BRB-9000), and Lilo is made the Galactic Federation's ambassador to Earth and the experiments' guardian. The aliens initially decline the offers for Lilo's sake, but she later lets them go after seeing how much they long for their new adventures. Before they leave, Lilo gives Jumba her favorite Elvis Presley record, Pleakley a small rock to use as a paperweight, and Stitch a necklace with a Kū tiki.

While they enjoy what they are honored for, Jumba, Pleakley, Lilo, and Stitch begin to feel sad from their separation. Meanwhile, their arch-nemesis Gantu, having failed to capture Jumba's expermiments, decides to break his boss Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel out of prison, abandoning Experiment 625 in the process. Once freed, Hämsterviel develops a foolproof plan to take over the galaxy upon learning of Jumba's current status. He starts off by intruding the lab, where he captures Jumba and forces him to create a new Stitch-like experiment that he dubs Leroy. Stitch, on assignment to recapture Hämsterviel, arrives and duels Leroy, but is defeated and imprisoned in a capsule just as Pleakley arrives to visit Jumba, but is captured as well. Hämsterviel then clones Leroy for an army to conquer the Galactic Alliance. Before leaving for Turo, Hämsterviel continues with his plan in which he sets up a deathtrap for Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley by locking them in Pleakley's vehicle and sending it toward a black hole in order to destroy the three aliens for good.

On Earth, Lilo decides to contact Stitch but realizes that the only intergalactic videophone available on the planet is in Gantu's ship. Upon arrival, she finds 625 and asks to use the videophone, but it is not functional. Lilo, upon seeing 625 emotionally hurt, consoles and names him "Reuben" before he repairs the videophone. Lilo contacts the BRB-9000 to reach Stitch. Leroy, now in control of the ship, impersonates Stitch, but Lilo sees through his ruse upon noticing he is not wearing Stitch's tiki necklace, much to the delight of Hämsterviel, who thinks his plan is working perfectly. After Gantu reminds Hämsterviel of the threat of the other 624 experiments, he adds a brand new part to his plan by commanding Leroy to capture them as soon as possible so he could destroy all of them. Realizing Stitch is in danger, Lilo has Reuben repair Gantu's ship, and together, they fly to Turo and learn that Hämsterviel is responsible for Stitch's current predicament and has already taken over the galaxy. He then orders Gantu to imprison the duo.

As the G.A.C.C. vehicle heads towards the black hole, Stitch escapes his capsule and frees Jumba and Pleakley. He then throws Pleakley's rock into the black hole, disrupting its event horizon and enabling them to escape. On Earth, Leroy obtains Lilo's scrapbook of the experiments and captures them and Lilo's rival, Mertle Edmonds, and reports it to Hämsterviel afterwards. Realizing Leroy is the quickest experiment hunter in the galaxy, Hämsterviel fires Gantu before setting off to Earth to finish his plan by destroying the 624 experiments. After having a change of heart, Gantu helps Lilo and Reuben escape, and they return to Earth in the G.A.C.C. vehicle. Leroy and Hämsterviel gather the experiments at Aloha Stadium and prepare to kill them with the BRB-9000's cannon. The heroes arrive and destroy the cannon, but Hämsterviel unleashes the Leroys, who overwhelm the other experiments. Jumba then remembers that he programmed a secret shutdown command into Leroy during his creation that can be activated when he hears Elvis Presley's rendition of "Aloha ʻOe". They soon interrupt the battle to perform the song, triggering the Leroys' command and saving the day.

As the team is again honored by the alliance for their victory, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley ask to return to Earth with Lilo. The Grand Councilwoman grants this and reinstates Gantu as the captain of the Armada, with Reuben as a galley officer. Back on Earth, Lilo sets up for one last ''ʻohana'' photo with her family and Mertle. In a final scene, Hämsterviel, who is frustrated because his plan failed, is reincarcerated by the Amarda for his crimes in the movie with the Leroys in cells surrounding his. During the credits, a nearly-full list of Jumba's experiments is shown.
