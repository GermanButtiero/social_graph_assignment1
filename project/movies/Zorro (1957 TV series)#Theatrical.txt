==Plot==
For most of its run, ''Zorro'''s episodes were part of continuing [[story arc]]s, each about thirteen episodes long. It had a structure similar to a [[serial (radio and television)|serial]]. The first of these chronicles the emergence of Zorro/Diego to [[Spanish California|California]] in 1820, having returned from studying in [[Reign of Ferdinand VII of Spain|Spain]] at the behest of his father, Don Alejandro, to help depose the greedy and cruel local Comandante, Captain Enrique Sánchez Monastario. After Monastario's final defeat, in the second storyline, Zorro must uncover and counter Magistrado Carlos Galindo, who is part of a conspiracy to take over rule of California. The third story arc concerns the leader of that conspiracy, José Sebastián de Varga, a shadowy figure known as "The Eagle". It is revealed that Varga intends to make a huge profit by turning California over to another country, which had its own interests on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

Season two opens with Diego in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the colonial capital of [[Alta California]]. The authorities are worried that privately collected money to bring a supply ship to California is repeatedly diverted to a gang of bandits. Diego stays to investigate, both as a civilian and as the masked Zorro. He becomes interested in Ana Maria Verdugo, a daughter of the man organizing the effort. Once Zorro defeats the thieves, he enters into a rivalry with his old friend Ricardo del Amo, a practical joker who is also interested in Ana Maria. Ana Maria is in love with Zorro. While in Monterey, Zorro and Sergeant García also get involved in a dispute between the people and a repressive Lieutenant Governor. At the end of the Monterey Arc, Diego/Zorro is on the verge of giving up his mask to marry Ana Maria, but Don Alejandro talks him out of it, revealing that he had figured out his son was Zorro some time ago and convinces Diego that the people still need Zorro. Zorro (and Diego) says goodbye to Ana Maria and returns to Los Angeles, where he gets involved in a series of shorter adventures.

In one three-episode story arc, guest-starring [[Annette Funicello]], Zorro must solve the mystery of Anita Cabrillo's father, a man who does not seem to exist. Other storylines late in the series involve Diego's ne'er-do-well uncle (played by [[Cesar Romero]]), a plot against the governor of California, an encounter with an American "[[mountain man]]" ([[Jeff York]], reprising a role from ''The Saga of Andy Burnett''), and outwitting a greedy [[Diplomat|emissary]] from Spain.
