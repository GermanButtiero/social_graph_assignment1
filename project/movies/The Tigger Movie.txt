PLOT: In the Hundred Acre Wood, Tigger looks for someone to bounce with but finds his friends busy preparing for winter. While searching for a playmate, he accidentally destroys Eeyore's house with a boulder. Although he helps remove it, Tigger then unintentionally breaks Rabbit's pulley system, leading the group to admonish for his recklessness. Hurt by their words, Tigger confides in his closest friend, Roo, who asks whether Tigger has a family of his own. Inspired by the idea, Tigger resolves to find his relatives.

Misinterpreting advice from Owl, Tigger and Roo search for his "family tree", believing it to be a literal striped tree full of Tiggers, but they come up empty-handed. Following Roo's suggestion, Tigger writes a letter to his family and lets the wind carry it away, but after several days without a reply, he loses hope. Wanting to cheer him up, Tigger's friends compose a letter signed "your family". Believing his relatives are coming to visit, Tigger throws a party in their honor. Unable to tell him the truth, Roo convinces the others to disguise themselves as Tiggers and attend.

Despite their efforts, the ruse collapses when Roo's mask falls off during a difficult bounce that Tigger had taught him. Feeling betrayed, Tigger storms off into a blizzard to continue his search. He eventually comes across a massive tree covered in stripes of snow and mistakes it for his family tree, only to find it empty. When his friends arrive to retrieve him, their quarrel accidentally triggers an avalanche. Tigger rescues the group by bringing them to safety but is himself swept away. Roo recalls Tigger's special bounce, uses it successfully, and saves him. Afterward, Tigger learns that his friends wrote the letter, realizes they are his true family, and hosts a new party in their honor.
