==Plot==
One year after the events of the [[Treasure Buddies|previous film]], Bartleby and his dog Budderball are spending the summer at the farm of Bartleby's grandfather Marvin. On Bartleby's twelfth birthday, Marvin gives him the first issue of the comic book ''Kid Courageous and Captain Canine'', which details the origin of the superhero Captain Canine. He comes from the planet of Inspiron, which was peaceful until the alien [[Warlord|warlord]] Drex invaded, seeking to steal the Rings of Inspiron. The soldier Captain Megasis was tasked with taking the Rings to Earth despite Queen Jorala's reluctance. While doing so, he was attacked by Drex. In the ensuing battle, Drex was seemingly killed and Megasis safely landed on Earth with the Rings.

While celebrating his birthday with his friends, Bartleby's dogs find the Rings in a barn. When they return, Bartleby tells them the story of Captain Canine. After he landed in suburban [[Seattle]], Megasis took the form of a dog to hide from the police and began searching for the Rings. While doing so, he met a boy named Jack and the two began fighting crime as Kid Courageous and Captain Canine, with Jack adapting their adventures into comic form.

The next day, Captain Canine detects the Rings' energy source and he and a now grown-up Jack begin tracking the Rings along with Drex, who is revealed to have survived. Upon discovering that the Rings have given them superpowers—[[Supersonic speed|super speed]] for Rosebud, [[invisibility]] for Mudbud, [[Superhuman strength|super strength]] for Budderball, [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]] for B-Dawg, and [[telekinesis]] for Buddha—the dogs decide to use their powers for good.

Meanwhile, Drex lands near Marvin's farm, possesses a pig, and begins searching for the Rings. Marvin discovers this and calls Sheriff Dan but the sheriff does not believe what he saw. Dan leaves to investigate a call from dispatch that Drex has stolen Marvin's truck and crashed it into city hall, during which he captures and arrests Drex. While Bartleby and the children discover the pod and conclude that Drex has arrived, the dogs save a girl from a house fire with help from Captain Canine, who teaches them to use their powers.

While the children learn of the dogs' heroics from the news, Drex swaps bodies with Dan and escapes from the police station, capturing the children after they arrive to try to meet with Dan. Drex arrives at Marvin's farm, locks the kids in a barn, and uses his pod's weapon systems to direct a meteor towards Fernfield which causes a Lightning storm over the town. Captain Canine faces off against Drex only to be killed but the Buddies use what they learned to overwhelm him, with some help from Marvin, who uses a [[Lightning rod|lightning rod]] to electrocute Drex. This allows the dogs to escape and reunite with their owners at the barn, where Drex threatens to destroy them if they don't give him the Rings of Inspiron. After getting the Rings, he is confronted by Dan and Sniffer and gives the sheriff his body back before escaping. Drex later discovers the Rings of Inspiron he acquired were fake and loses control of his ship, which crashes into the meteor and kills him for good.

The Buddies use the Rings to resurrect Captain Canine, who returns to Inspiron with Drex's former assistant Monk-E, and Jorala after reverting to his true form. Afterwards, Jack and Bartleby create a new comic book series about the dogs.
