PLOT: On 4 May, 1865, in a park in Oxford, England, a young girl named Alice listens distractedly to her sister's history lesson, and begins daydreaming of a nonsensical world. She spots a passing White Rabbit in a waistcoat, who complains of being late. Alice chases him into a burrow and plummets down a deep hole. Upon landing, she finds herself facing a tiny door, whose handle advises drinking from a bottle on a nearby table. She shrinks to an appropriate height, but has forgotten the key on the table. She then eats a cookie that causes her to grow excessively. Exasperated by these changes of state, she begins to cry and floods the room. She takes another sip from the bottle to shrink again, and rides the empty bottle through the keyhole. 

As Alice continues to follow the Rabbit, she encounters Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who recount the tale of "The Walrus and the Carpenter". Alice tracks the Rabbit to his house; he mistakes her for his housemaid and sends her inside to retrieve his gloves. While searching for the gloves, Alice finds and eats a cookie and grows giant, getting stuck in the house. Thinking her a monster, the Rabbit asks the Dodo to help expel her. Before the Dodo can burn the house down, Alice escapes by eating a carrot from the Rabbit's garden and shrinking to three inches tall.

Alice meets a garden of talking flowers who initially welcome her with a song, but then banish her, accusing her of being a weed. Alice then encounters a Caterpillar, who becomes enraged at Alice after she laments her small size (which is the same as the Caterpillar's). The Caterpillar turns into a butterfly and flies away after advising Alice to eat a piece from different sides of a mushroom to alter her size. Following a period of trial and error, she returns to her original height and keeps the remaining pieces on hand. In the woods, Alice gets stuck between multiple paths and encounters the Cheshire Cat, who suggests questioning the Mad Hatter or the March Hare. Taking her own path, Alice encounters both, along with the Dormouse, in the midst of an "unbirthday" celebration. Alice attempts to explain her predicament, but becomes frustrated by the Hatter and Hare's interruptions and absurd logic. The Rabbit appears and the Hatter attempts to repair his pocket watch, which results in its destruction, and the Rabbit is thrown out of the party. Alice abandons her pursuit and decides to go home, but gets lost in the Tulgey Wood.

The Cheshire Cat appears to the despondent Alice and offers a path to the Queen of Hearts. In the Queen's labyrinthine garden, Alice witnesses the Queen – whom the Rabbit serves as a chamberlain – sentencing a trio of playing cards to execution for painting mistakenly-planted white rosebushes red. The Queen invites Alice to a croquet match, in which live flamingos, card guards, and hedgehogs are used as equipment, but the equipment rig the game in favor of the Queen. The Cheshire Cat reappears and plays a trick on the Queen, setting up Alice to be framed. The King spares Alice by suggesting a formal trial, in which the Cheshire Cat invokes more chaos by having Alice point him out, causing one of the witnesses – the Dormouse – to panic. As the Queen orders Alice's execution, Alice eats the mushroom pieces to grow large, momentarily intimidating the court. However, the mushroom's effect is short-lived, forcing Alice to flee the deteriorating realm and its pursuing denizens. When Alice reaches the small door she encountered, she sees herself sleeping through the keyhole. Alice emerges from her dream, and she returns home for tea with her sister.
