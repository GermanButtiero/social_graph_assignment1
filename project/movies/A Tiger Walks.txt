==Plot==
Raja, a mistreated [[Bengal tiger]], escapes from a traveling [[circus]], and it hides in the woods surrounding the small town of Scotia. The new arrival starts a panic, and the townsfolk want Raja killed with the exception of Julie Williams ([[Pamela Franklin]]), the sheriff's daughter. Julie wishes to capture Raja and put it in a [[zoo]]. To raise enough money to purchase Raja from the circus, she starts a campaign with the slogan "save the tiger" to rally children across the nation in the tiger's defense, resulting in national attention brought to the sleepy town.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://movies.disney.com/a-tiger-walks | title= A Tiger Walks | website= movies.disney.com | publisher= | date= | access-date=}}</ref> However, she, her father, and an [[India]]n tiger trainer first need to find Raja before the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], who are under orders to shoot the tiger on sight. Ultimately the tiger is tranquilized and placed in a zoo.
