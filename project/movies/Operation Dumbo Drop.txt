PLOT: During the Vietnam War, Green Beret Captain Sam Cahill has been developing good relations between the United States and the Montagnard Vietnamese villagers of Dak Nhe, which occupies ground suitable for observing the clandestine Ho Chi Minh trail. With his tour of duty ending, Cahill must train his successor, and Captain T.C. Doyle learns about the delicate nature of Vietnamese customs as well as counterintelligence involving covert enemy activity.

A local child steals a Nestlé Crunch bar from Doyle's backpack. Soldiers from the NVA discover the wrapper, interpreting it as proof the village is cooperating with the Americans. On Brigadier Nguyen's orders, NVA Captain Quang kills the villagers' elephant as punishment. The villagers blame Doyle for the elephant's death, and Cahill promises to replace the slain elephant in time for a scheduled spiritual festival.

Major Pederson assigns Cahill and Doyle to secure and deliver a new elephant to the villagers, assisted by Specialist Harvey Ashford and Specialist Lawrence Farley. Cahill also blackmails Chief Warrant Officer David Poole into helping. They purchase an elephant known as Bo Tat (Bồ Tát) from a local Vietnamese trader and bring along child handler, Linh, whose verbal commands Bo Tat responds well to. Following a failed air transport, the soldiers use a combination of methods to reach Pleiku Air Base before the final stage of their journey to Dak Nhe.

At Pleiku Air Base, the team learns that the Ho Chi Minh Trail has shifted, and since Dak Nhe is no longer strategically placed, the mission to replace the elephant is cancelled. A nearby CIA airstrip has been destroyed by the NVA, making a landing by plane impossible. Against regulations, the team commandeers a cargo aircraft to parachute from over Dak Nhe. Enemy fire forces them to parachute out early with Bo Tat. Quang is lying in wait, with orders from Nguyen to also kill Bo Tat, but he refuses, explaining that "I did not join this army to shoot elephants, especially ones that fly." The soldiers land unharmed in and around the village, though Ashford, gets hung up in a tree and separated from the others. NVA forces threaten to take the team hostage and kill the elephant. Ashford frees himself and creates a diversion to distract then incapacitate the NVA troops, and high-ranking enemy officers are captured. 

The villagers hold their festival with Bo Tat in the place of honor. Cahill is told by radio the supply route has changed direction again, making Dak Nhe a strategic location once more. The U.S. Army sanctions the relief mission ''post-facto'', and confirm Doyle's original mission, to replace Cahill as liaison officer in the village.
