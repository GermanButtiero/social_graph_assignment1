PLOT: The students of Spangalis College go on an active week-long study trip to the Ardennes Forest in Belgium. Teacher Jochem Damstra accompanies them as does English teacher Madge Johnson. Arriving in the forest near the base camp, the students are supposed to work in teams to complete all kinds of tasks, but this is not without its problems. As a result, they sometimes even end up in dangerous situations. During the highlight of the work week, the “dropping”, there is fierce competition between the two groups and the certainty of a good outcome is far from certain. Working together is necessary to safely find their way back to camp.

Flip and Tobias van Hamel are twin brothers. Flip is openly gay; his boyfriend Koen, who is not going with him, breaks up with him, but they still kiss each other as a farewell. Tobias incites Flip to bully him, such as throwing away a stuffed toy to which Irmak Sertkaya is attached. Tobias also squeezes a tube of honey empty into someone's bag. As a result, they get into a fight.

Barry Hartveld is out of school and comes on his own. He is not allowed to join the program, but hangs around with the students. Barry is in love with Lana van Hamel and even kisses her. When Nassim Gharbi discovers them, he becomes furious. He immediately puts a stop to his relationship with Lana and flies at Barry. The two go at it fist, while Lana and Jolé van Haagendoorn look on.

During the drop, which is done in two competing teams, the weather suddenly turns very bad with storms and thunderstorms. Tobias changes a clue, causing the other group including Flip, Avalanche Blokland, Annabella Vermeulen and Luxor de Haan to get lost and have to spend a night in a cave. On the way there, Flip falls and hears a crack around his arm. Tobias paranormally feels Flip's pain. Luxor discovers that the arm is only dislocated. It is reset and Flip is given a sling made from Marjana El Asmi's headscarf. 

The next morning, the weather has improved and they head back to base camp. Luxor, who had earlier copied the clue found, is still able to interpret it correctly, so they find their way back. The group with Tobias sets out on one of the rafts to look for the other group, which stays away for a long time. However, the river is still wild due to the precipitation that night, so the boat overturns. Fay nearly drowns in the process and has to be resuscitated. Everyone eventually returns to safety.
