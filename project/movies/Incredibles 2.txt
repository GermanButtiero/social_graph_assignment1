PLOT: The Parrs (The Incredibles) and Lucius Best (Frozone) battle The Underminer in Municiberg. The superheroes prevent the villain from destroying city hall, but fail to stop him from robbing a bank and making his escape. The resulting massive property damage prompt the government to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, ending financial assistance for the "supers". Violet's classmate and love interest, Tony Rydinger, discovers her superhero identity; Agent Rick Dicker accidentally erases Tony's entire knowledge of Violet instead of just this incident.

Wealthy siblings Winston and Evelyn Deavor, who run the telecommunications company DevTech, propose secret missions to Helen, Bob, and Lucius, which are to be recorded and broadcast in a movement to regain public trust in superheroes. Winston chooses Helen for their initial missions as she has caused the least property damage. Initially reluctant to be away from her family and risking getting into trouble with the law, Helen accepts after a talk with Bob. Meanwhile, Winston rehouses the Parrs in a luxury mansion.

Bob struggles in his new role as a stay-at-home parent, left to deal with Violet's dejection over Tony forgetting their first date, Dash's math homework, and the chaos of baby Jack-Jack's burgeoning superpowers. He suppresses envy for Helen and, at Lucius's advice, calls on Edna Mode to babysit Jack-Jack. Meanwhile, in the city of New Urbem, Helen encounters the supervillain Screenslaver, a hacker who can perform hypnosis through any screen. After preventing him from destroying a crowded hovertrain and thwarting his assassination attempt on an ambassador, she tracks his signals and infiltrates his base. Defeating him, she unmasks him only to discover a disoriented pizza delivery driver. At a party celebrating Helen's success, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize the supers on live television, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the ''Everjust'', and attended by all "supers" coming out of hiding.

Helen realizes Screenslaver lured her to a decoy double, and the pizza delivery driver was under the control of hypnotic goggles. Evelyn reveals herself to be the true Screenslaver and hypnotizes Helen, restraining her using her goggles and a freezing cell that negates her self-stretching superpower. Evelyn blames society's overdependence on the "supers" for the deaths of her and Winston's parents, as their father was shot by burglars after the newly outlawed supers Fironic and Gazerbeam did not answer his calls for aid, and their mother died of grief. Evelyn plans to sabotage her brother's summit to ruin the reputation of all "supers" once more and keep them outlawed in the hopes that the public will be safer with self-sufficient crimefighting.

Evelyn lures Bob into a trap on the ''Everjust'', goggling him too, and sends six hypnotized supers to subdue Violet and Dash. Lucius arrives to protect them but is overwhelmed and goggled as well. Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack escape in the Incredibile, the supercar once owned by Bob, and, deducing their parents are in danger, stow away on the ''Everjust''. Onboard, Helen, Bob, and Lucius are forced to broadcast themselves, giving villainous speeches, subduing the ship's crew, and locking its course towards Municiberg at a disastrous pace. When the children arrive, Jack-Jack removes the goggles on Helen, who in turn frees Bob and Lucius. They work together to release the other mind-controlled supers and safely prevent the ''Everjust's'' collision with the city. Evelyn tries to escape in the yacht's parasite jet, but is then caught by Helen and arrested.

With another disaster averted and the positive publicity surrounding this, supers around the world regain their legal status. Sometime later, Tony is picked up by Violet and her family in the Incredibile for their reinstated movie date. They spot a police chase; Violet leaves Tony at the cinema, promising a quick return, before the Parrs don their superhero masks and join the pursuit.
