PLOT: The Bakers, a blended family, began with Paul and Kate Baker, who had daughters Ella and Harley. After their friends died in a car accident, they took in their godson, Haresh. Kate eventually divorced Paul, but they stayed friends, with Kate occasionally babysitting.

Zoey married football player Dominic "Dom" Clayton and had two children, Deja and DJ. However, due to Dom's celebrity lifestyle, Zoey divorced him, gaining custody. She met Paul at his restaurant and suggested making the menu breakfast-themed all day. They married, expanded the restaurant into Baker's Breakfast, and had two sets of twins: Luca and Luna, and Bronx and Bailey.

Dom remains involved in Deja and DJ's lives, intimidating Paul, who was rarely present. As Deja prepares for her USC basketball scholarship, DJ feels a stronger connection with Paul than Dom. Paul secures a meeting with a major company to expand his restaurant and successfully gets his famous sauce on store shelves. He uses the earnings to move the family and their dogs, Bark Obama and Joe Bitin', from Los Angeles to a bigger house in Calabasas, in a gated community.

Zoey feels the effects of racial profiling after meeting her neighbor, Anne. Paul receives a call that his sister Rachel is in rehab, so he takes in his nephew Seth, whom Ella and Harley label a criminal. Seth bonds with Haresh, who is bullied for his ethnicity, teaching him self-defense while making monster spray for his cousins. Deja, rarely used on the Calabasa Hornets basketball team, sneaks out to see her new boyfriend Chris.

Paul travels to find new restaurant locations as investors Melanie and Michele push for changes to cut costs. He misses time with family, upsetting Zoey, who divorced Dom for similar reasons. Haresh and Seth are suspended for a week after fighting bullies, leading Zoey to ground them. On DJ's birthday, Paul rushes home, but the party spirals when DJ changes his look for a girl. Anne investigates a string of break-ins involving Zoey's family. Upon arrival, Deja reveals she quit the basketball team and the family's unhappiness in Calabasas. Concerned about Zoey and Paul's ability to parent, Dom announces he will seek full custody of Deja and DJ.

Harley and Ella accuse Seth of the break-ins after Haresh claims he saw him stealing from the cash register. Though Seth returned the money, he storms out in anger. Paul and Zoey tell them the money is from DCFS, given to Seth, and that someone broke into Anne's house during the party while Seth was grounded. Realizing their mistake, the Bakers, Kate, and Dom find Seth, apologize, and admit he is part of the family, though he rejoins them reluctantly at first.

At home, Paul and Dom reflect on their upbringings. Paul doesn't know disadvantage, while Dom realizes his absence from his kids has made him distant. Understanding his family's importance, Paul breaks his company deal to manage the restaurant himself. The Bakers relocate to Los Angeles, buy a new house, and the kids return to their old schools, with Deja rejoining her basketball team. During breakfast for dinner at Baker's Dozen Breakfast, Paul unveils a new sauce bottle design that includes Seth.

Dom, Paul, and Zoey invested their sauce and went national. Kate invented bird yoga. Seth moved back in with his mom after rehab but still spends time with his cousins. Deja and Chris started freshman year together. Ella became the social manager for Harley's punk band and went viral after performing at her school talent show. Luna and Luca won the national under 12 tennis division, reminiscent of Venus and Serena Williams. DJ, Talia, and Dom bonded at Comic-Con.
