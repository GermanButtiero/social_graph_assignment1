In 1897 London, a young mouse Olivia Flaversham celebrates her birthday with her single <!---The film never explains whether Olivia's mother is dead or simply gone----> father, [[wikt:toymaker|toymaker]] Mr. Flaversham. A bat with a crippled wing and a [[peg leg]] arrives unexpectedly, kidnapping Flaversham. Olivia leaves to find Basil of Baker Street, the famous Great Mouse Detective. David Q. Dawson, a retired army surgeon mouse returning from [[Afghanistan]], meets Olivia and escorts her to Basil's residence. 

After meeting the detective, Olivia mentions the bat abducting her father. Basil realizes Olivia saw Fidget, the assistant of Professor Ratigan; an elusive criminal mastermind. It is revealed that Ratigan kidnapped Flaversham to force him to create a [[clockwork]] [[robot]] replica of the Queen of the Mice, usurping her place as "Supreme Ruler of all Mousedom". Flaversham initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but capitulates when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia.

During their conversation, Fidget appears in Basil's window, then suddenly disappears. Basil, Dawson and Olivia take Toby, [[Sherlock Holmes]]' pet [[Basset Hound]], to trail Fidget's scent. They trace him to a human-sized toyshop. Dawson finds Fidget's checklist, discovering that he has been stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. The bat ambushes and snatches Olivia away, before Basil and Dawson can stop him. 

Back at Baker street, Basil does chemical tests to the checklist, discovering it came from the "Rat Trap", a tavern near the junction of the sewer and the [[Thames]]. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors, and head to the tavern. There they spot Fidget, following him to Ratigan's headquarters, only to be ambushed by Ratigan and his henchmen. Ratigan has the pair tied to a spring-loaded mousetrap connected to a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] of various killing devices. Ratigan then sets out for [[Buckingham Palace]], where his henchmen hijack the royal guards roles and kidnap the Mouse Queen. Inspired by a remark Dawson made, Basil deduces the trap's weakness, freeing himself, Dawson and Olivia.

At Buckingham Palace, Ratigan orders Flaversham to operate the toy Queen, while the latter is taken to be fed to Felicia, Ratigan's pet cat. The toy Queen declares Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his dictatorial plans for his new "subjects". After the trio save Flaversham and the real Queen, they restrain Fidget including the henchmen, as Toby chases Felicia away. Basil seizes control of the toy, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud, breaking itself into pieces. Realizing Ratigan's [[treason]], the enraged crowd attacks, but Ratigan escapes on his [[dirigible]] with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage.

Basil, Dawson, and Flaversham create an airship from a matchbox, balloons, and a [[Union Jack]] flag, to pursue an escaping Ratigan. After Ratigan tosses Fidget overboard, Basil jumps onto the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing it to crash straight into [[Elizabeth Tower|Big Ben]]'s clockface. Inside the clocktower, Basil restrains Ratigan, rescues Olivia, and safely delivers her to Flaversham. Ratigan breaks free and attacks Basil, just before the [[striking clock|clock strikes 10:00]], causing Ratigan to fall to his death. He attempts to take Basil with him, but the detective grabs a part of Ratigan's dirigible and saves himself.

Back at home, the group recounts their adventures. The Flavershams bid a fond farewell and leave to catch their train. Dawson reluctantly resolves to leave as well, before a new client arrives. Basil accepts her case, introducing Dawson  as his investigative partner, prompting Dawson to remain and assist Basil.
