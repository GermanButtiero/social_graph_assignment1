==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
In 1986, American [[viticulture|wine grower]] Nicholas "Nick" Parker and British [[wedding gown]] designer Elizabeth "Liz" James meet during a cruise on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', fall in love, and eventually marry. Liz then gives birth to twin daughters, Annie and Hallie, but she and Nick divorce soon after, with each gaining custody of one of the girls. Nick raises Hallie on his vineyard in [[Napa, California]], while Liz raises Annie in [[London, England]].

Nearly 12 years later, in 1998, the twins are sent to the same all-girls summer camp in [[Maine]], Camp Walden. Annie and Hallie first meet at the end of a [[fencing]] match when they remove their masks and see that they look identical. A hostility between the twins leads to a prank war that ends when the camp counselors fall into one of Hallie's traps and decide to isolate the twins from the other girls.

Living together in an isolation cabin, Annie and Hallie discover that they were born on the same day, and each has half of a torn wedding photograph of their parents. Realizing with delight that they are twin sisters, they hatch a plan to reunite their parents and get them to remarry. Each twin trains the other to impersonate her, with the intent to switch places at the end of summer camp.

In London, Hallie meets Liz, the family [[butler]] Martin, and her maternal grandfather Charles, while Annie meets Nick and their family [[nanny]] Chessy in California. Much to Annie's dismay, she learns that Nick is engaged to Meredith Blake, a 26-year-old [[gold digger|gold-digging]] publicist from San Francisco. Meredith acts friendly toward "Hallie", but she reveals to her assistant Richard that she plans to send Hallie to boarding school in [[Timbuktu]] after the wedding. Annie phones Hallie and implores her to bring Liz to California to try to break up Nick and Meredith, but Hallie refuses, desperate to spend more one-on-one time with Liz.

After Chessy notices changes in "Hallie's" behavior, Annie confesses her identity to Chessy, who agrees to keep it a secret from Nick. While on the phone with Annie discussing Nick's impending wedding to Meredith, Hallie is caught by Charles, who encourages her to tell Liz the truth. After doing so, Liz is surprised but happy to learn that she has been with Hallie since the end of camp, and they both decide to travel to California to establish joint custody of the twins between each parent.

The twins, with Martin and Chessy's help, arrange for a meeting between Nick and Liz at the Stafford Hotel in California. Upon reuniting with Liz, Nick happily learns that he has had Annie with him since the end of camp. Liz also meets Meredith and learns about her engagement with Nick. Annie and Hallie, with Chessy and Martin's help, attempt to recreate the night their parents met by arranging dinner on a yacht. Nick and Liz discuss their breakup, which occurred when Liz ran off after a fight, secretly hoping that Nick would follow her. They agree on shared custody of the twins but decide not to resume their relationship. Liz plans to fly back to London with Annie the next day, but the twins refuse to reveal which one is which unless the entire family takes a camping trip. Liz insists that Meredith go in her place so that she can become acquainted with the twins before marrying Nick.

On the trip, the twins play a series of pranks on Meredith, leading her to furiously demand that Nick choose between her and them. Finally seeing Meredith's true nature, Nick breaks up with her. After the camping trip, Nick and Liz realize that they are still in love, but decide to go their separate ways, each with the twin that they have respective custody of. When Liz and Annie return to London, they find Nick and Hallie, who had taken a flight on [[Concorde]]. Nick says that he does not want to make the same mistake of not going after Liz again, and they share a kiss.

The end credits reveal that Liz and Nick have remarried, with Annie and Hallie as their bridesmaids, and that Chessy and Martin have become engaged.
