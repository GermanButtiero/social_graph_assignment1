==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words only. -->
As a child, [[Mike Wazowski]] visits the Monsters Inc. factory on a class field trip to learn about how "scarers" harness human children's screams for energy to power the monster world. He secretly follows a scarer through a door to the human world to watch him work; the scarer is surprised with Mike's dangerous actions, yet impressed with his stealth and gives him his Monsters University (MU) cap.

Years later, Mike enrolls in the scaring program at MU and is assigned [[Randall Boggs|Randall "Randy" Boggs]] as a roommate. On the first day of class, Abigail Hardscrabble, the dean of the scaring program and president of MU, warns that students who fail the first semester's final exam will leave the scaring program. Mike then encounters [[James P. "Sulley" Sullivan]], the son of a famous scarer. Sulley gets into the top [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] on campus, RΩR (Roar Omega Roar), which rejects Mike for not looking scary enough. Over the next few months, Mike works and studies hard to improve himself while Sulley slacks off, relying on his family name and natural talent. An intense rivalry forms between Mike and Sulley throughout the semester, seeing each other as the antithesis of their views on success. On exam day, the duo's rivalry gets out of control when they inadvertently destroy Hardscrabble's prized scream canister. She personally tests and fails them both; Sulley for a lack of technical knowledge and rushing and Mike for not being physically "scary" as the former is promptly kicked out of RΩR.

Next semester, both Sulley and Mike switch majors from scaring to scream can design. Sulley is grumpy at Mike while Mike feels hopeless and upset that he cannot continue in the scaring program due to his appearance. Determined to prove his worth, Mike enters the annual Scare Games with OK (Oozma Kappa), a small fraternity of misfits, as his team, and makes a deal with Hardscrabble: if OK wins, they and Mike will return to the scare program, or else Mike will have to leave MU. Short one team member for full entry into the games, Sulley volunteers. With Randy betraying Mike to join RΩR's team and thus ending his friendship with Mike, he begrudgingly accepts Sulley. Initially, OK places last in the first round but are saved from elimination when another team is disqualified for cheating, and barely pass the second round. The RΩRs invite OK to a mid-game party, then stage a humiliating prank on them and post pictures of it all over campus. The team becomes discouraged, so Mike takes them to Monsters Inc., where they sneak in and watch the scarers using their differences as advantages. After being chased off by security, the rejuvenated team begins to work together under Mike's coaching and passes the next two challenges right behind RΩR. In the final challenge, OK and RΩR face off in a simulator in 1v1 matches, each trying to frighten a dummy child. OK wins after Mike racks up a maximum score with his scare.

However, Mike later discovers that Sulley had rigged the simulator's settings for Mike's turn to guarantee a win, leading to a falling out between the duo. The rest of OK discard the trophy in disappointment as Sulley, ashamed of what he had done, admits his guilt to Hardscrabble. Outraged at Sulley's betrayal, deciding that no one could be trusted to allow him a fair chance, and still determined to prove he is scary, Mike sneaks through an experimental door to the human world into a [[summer camp]] cabin full of children, only to find that none of them are afraid of him. Feeling responsible for Mike's predicament, Sulley sneaks past security and Hardscrabble to go after Mike. Sulley admits to Mike his own fears and they make amends just as Hardscrabble deactivates the door to keep the other monsters safe as children are seemingly toxic to monsters. The duo collaborate to scare the rangers, creating enough energy to power the door from their side, and they escape just as it explodes.

Sulley and Mike are expelled from MU as punishment for their actions, but the other OK members are invited into the scaring program. As Mike and Sulley leave, Hardscrabble admits they surprised her and changed her outlook on a monster's potential as scarers, and expresses her hope that they can continue to surprise others moving forward. The duo go to work for Monsters Inc. in the mailroom and over the years work their way up through the ranks in the company until Sulley becomes a scarer, with Mike as his scare assistant.
