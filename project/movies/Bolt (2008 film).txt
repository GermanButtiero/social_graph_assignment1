PLOT: In 2003, a White Swiss Shepherd puppy named Bolt is adopted by a 7-year-old girl named Penny. Five years later in 2008, Bolt and Penny star in a hit television series named after Bolt, in which Bolt and Penny fight crime and foil the plans of the villain, Dr. Calico, who has kidnapped Penny's father, with Bolt using various superpowers in their adventures. To gain a more realistic performance from Bolt, the show's director has arranged the special effects in such a way that Bolt believes everything in the show is real, including his powers. This means Bolt can never leave the set and live as a normal dog, much to Penny's dismay. 

One day, after a cliffhanger episode causes Bolt to believe Penny has been kidnapped, he escapes from his on-set trailer in Hollywood but knocks himself unconscious and falls into a box of packing peanuts, which is then shipped to New York City. Upon arrival, Bolt is shocked to discover that his "superpowers" are actually useless. While searching for Dr. Calico and Penny, Bolt meets a group of pigeons who lead him to Mittens, a cynical feral cat who he believes is an "agent" of Calico and forces her to guide him back to Penny. The two travel to Ohio by stowing away in a U-Haul truck. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, a less-experienced White Swiss Shepherd dog is brought in so filming can resume. Penny is distraught over Bolt’s disappearance but reluctantly agrees to halt the search so production can continue.

Upon arriving in Ohio, Bolt and Mittens go to an RV park where they are joined by Rhino, a fearless hamster and huge fan of ''Bolt''. Rhino's description of Bolt's adventures causes Mittens to realize Bolt is from a TV show, but she is unable to convince Bolt of the truth. In frustration, Bolt repeatedly attempts to "superbark" Mittens, but the noise draws the attention of the local animal control service, and Bolt and Mittens are both captured and taken to a shelter.

Bolt, badly damaged by himself and freed from the patrol van by Rhino, finally realizes and accepts that he is just a normal dog. However, he regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to the revelation) gives him a motivating speech, and they later rescue Mittens from the shelter. As they travel west, Bolt and Mittens form a close friendship; she teaches him how to be an ordinary dog and enjoy typical dog activities. Mittens makes plans for the three of them to stay in Las Vegas, but Bolt is still determined to find Penny. Mittens reveals to Bolt that she was declawed and abandoned by her owners and believes that no human truly "loves" their pet. Bolt vehemently disagrees with her and continues on alone to Hollywood. After finding out about Bolt's departure, Rhino decides to follow Bolt to Hollywood and convinces Mittens to come with him.

When Bolt reaches California and the studio, he finds Penny embracing the replacement dog during a rehearsal, and, believing that she has replaced him, leaves feeling heartbroken. Mittens, who has caught up to him and witnessed the events, reassures Bolt that Penny does love him. At the same time, the Bolt look-alike panics during the show's routinely violent filming of a fight scene and accidentally knocks over lit tiki torches, setting the stage on fire with Penny trapped inside. With the help of Mittens and Rhino, Bolt goes inside the burning studio and the two reunite but are unable to escape and Penny begins to suffocate from the smoke. Bolt stays with Penny and repeatedly superbarks into the building's air vent, alerting the firefighters to their location, and they are rescued.

Penny and her mother quit the show after Penny's agent proposes that they exploit the incident for publicity. The show continues with new actors replacing Bolt and Penny and a bizarre new storyline involving alien abduction inspired by the movie's pigeon chorus. Penny adopts Mittens and Rhino, and they move to a rural home to enjoy a simpler lifestyle together.
