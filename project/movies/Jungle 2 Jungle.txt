==Plot==
Michael Cromwell is a self-absorbed [[commodity broker|commodities broker]] living in [[New York City]]. Wanting to marry his fiancée, Charlotte, he needs to obtain a divorce from his first wife, Patricia, who left him years earlier. She now lives with a semi-Westernized tribe in [[Canaima National Park]], [[Venezuela]]. He travels there to get her signature on the divorce papers. Upon his arrival, she reveals that they have a son named Mimi-Siku, who is now 13.

Michael attempts to bond with Mimi and promises to take him to New York City "[[coming of age|when he is a man]]". That night, Mimi undergoes the traditional [[rite of passage]] of the tribe, who then considers him to be a man. The tribal elder gives him a task to bring fire from the [[Statue of Liberty]] in order to become the next chief. A reluctant Michael brings Mimi to New York City with him.

Charlotte is less than pleased about Mimi and his primitive ways. As Michael attempts to adapt Mimi to city life, cross-cultural misunderstandings occur. On climbing the Statue of Liberty to reach the torch, he is disappointed that the flame is not real. 

While staying at the home of Michael's business partner Richard Kempster, Mimi falls in love with his daughter, Karen. Richard resents Mimi's presence due to his influence over Karen and because he ate his prize-winning ''[[Sailfin molly|Poecilia latipinna]]'' fish. Richard freaks out when he sees Karen and Mimi together in a [[hammock]] and threatens to send her to an all-girls [[summer camp]]; Mimi also attempts to make amends by replacing Richard's fish with wild ones, but Richard is not appeased.

The Kempsters and Michael are targeted by Alexei Jovanovic, a [[Russian mafia|Russian mobster]] and caviar dealer who believes that they have cheated him in a business deal. He arrives at the Kempsters' home and tortures Richard for information. By fighting together and utilizing Mimi's hunting skills and his pet tarantula Maitika (who attacks whenever people scream), Michael and Mimi fight off Jovanovic and his minions.

Before returning to the Amazon jungle, Mimi is given a satellite phone by Michael so they can stay in touch. He also presents him with a Statue of Liberty cigarette lighter, which produces fire from the torch and will fulfill his quest. In return, Mimi gives Michael a [[Blowgun|blowpipe]] and poisoned darts, telling him to practice and come to see him when he can hit flies.

Shortly afterward, Michael finds himself disheartened by his relationship with Charlotte and attempts to kill a fly with his blowpipe on the trading floor of the [[New York Board of Trade]]. He hits it but also his hot-tempered boss Langston, who collapses asleep on the trading floor.

Michael returns to Lipo-Lipo to see Mimi and Patricia, bringing the Kempsters along for a vacation. Karen and Mimi are reunited, and it is suggested that Michael and Patricia also resume their relationship.

As the closing credits start rolling, Michael undergoes the rite of passage as Mimi did earlier.
