== Plot ==
Eleven-year-old Preston Waters laments his relative lack of money compared to his entrepreneurial older brothers and his [[White-collar worker|white collar]] father, an investor. His situation regularly leads him to humiliating situations including having his brothers, 16-year-old Damian and 15-year-old Ralph, invade his bedroom to use as an office for their home business. He is also forced to attend his classmate Butch's birthday party at Cliffside Fun Park, where he is unable to afford anything other than the [[kiddie ride]]s because his father is very frugal with money.

One day, he gets involved in a bike accident with escaped convict Carl Quigley, who had just left a [[Zero Halliburton]] briefcase containing $1,000,000 in stolen cash in the care of bank president Edward H. Biderman to be [[Money laundering|laundered]] and retrieved by an associate the next day. Afraid of drawing attention from the police, Quigley hastily hands Preston a signed blank check and flees the scene.

Preston uses his computer to fill out the check himself for $1,000,000 and attempts to cash it the next day. He is taken to Biderman, who believes Preston is the associate named “Juice” that Quigley told him he was sending. Believing this is part of Quigley's plan, Biderman fills Preston's backpack with $1,000,000 in clean money and Preston leaves the bank just as the real Juice arrives for the money. An angered Quigley sets out to find Preston with Juice hoping to reclaim his stolen money and threatens Biderman's family with death unless he comes along. Meanwhile, Preston goes on a spending spree, purchasing a large house and a limousine service with a chauffeur named Henry, and then fills the house with toys, gadgets, and electronics all in the name of a mysterious employer he creates named "Macintosh", after [[Macintosh IIvi|his brothers' computer]]. Preston uses a computer program called [[PlainTalk|MacSpeak]] as the voice of Mr. Macintosh when he needs to conduct business over the phone, otherwise Preston presents himself as Mr. Macintosh's assistant.

Shay Stanley, a teller from the bank, seeks out Preston and his employer Mr. Macintosh, after the realtor who sold the house to Macintosh deposits $300,000 cash with her bank. Shay, an undercover FBI agent investigating Biderman for money laundering, is suspicious of the sudden flow of cash that has come through Biderman's bank and follows the trail to Preston/Macintosh. Denied a meeting with Macintosh, Preston claims that he handles some of Macintosh's financial affairs and the two end up going on a business date. Later, Preston throws an expensive birthday party for himself and Macintosh for which the party planner Yvonne takes at least $40,000 in cash from Preston, claiming it covers the fees for the event. Yvonne later gives Preston the party planning bill and cost which is $100,000. Preston invites Shay and Henry to the party, with many others showing up. At the party, Preston learns that he only has $332 left and that he cannot pay the planner what he owes for the party.

Still checking on the computer, his dad shows up talking to the so-called Macintosh. He tells him that if he sees Preston, to send him home because it is his birthday. Preston's dad takes a moment talking about his son and is afraid how he does not want to lose Preston and to grow up and to be like him not having fun. He leaves just before Preston starts crying. During the party, Preston tells Yvonne that Macintosh has left and there is no more money, the planner shuts the party down, leaving Preston alone in the empty house. Quigley, Biderman, and Juice arrive and demand Preston return the money, only to find out Preston has spent all of it in six days; Biderman tells Quigley about adopting the Macintosh name in hopes of inheriting the new life he was hoping for. However, Preston escapes, and the three pursue him throughout the property. Although Preston manages to fend off his pursuers by using his various purchases, they eventually catch up to him, but the FBI shows up with Shay in time to save him.

Quigley announces that he is Macintosh, thinking that assuming the false identity would grant him the new life he was seeking after escaping prison. However, the FBI arrest Quigley for numerous crimes they intended to charge to Macintosh, along with Biderman and Juice as accomplices. Preston bids Henry farewell and shares a goodbye kiss with Shay before returning to his family to celebrate his birthday, now understanding that money cannot buy happiness and that family is what matters most.
