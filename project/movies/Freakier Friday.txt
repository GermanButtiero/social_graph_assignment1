PLOT: Twenty-two years after the body swapping incident, a now adult Anna Coleman works as a music producer and raises her teenage daughter Harper as a single parent with the occasional help of her mother Tess. At school, Harper is constantly annoyed by her new classmate, British immigrant Lily Reyes, due to her snobbish personality.

When Harper and Lily cause an incident in chemistry class, Anna is called to the principal's office. When she meets Lily's father Eric, the two fall in love and become engaged six months later. The soon-to-be stepsisters are dissatisfied with their predicament; Harper is worried that her mother will relocate them to London, while Lily is adamant to return there so she can attend a fashion academy in honor of her late mother. During Anna's bachelorette party, Anna and Tess and later Harper and Lily have separate palm readings from the supposed psychic Madame Jen, who tells Harper and Lily a fortune about their fractured lives. An earthquake then occurs, which only the four feel. The next morning, they discover that they switched bodies: Anna with Harper, and Tess with Lily.

The experienced Anna and Tess advise Harper and Lily to pretend to be each other rather than telling anyone about the switch until they can change back. Realizing their new identities could help them break their parents apart, Harper and Lily lie about Madame Jen giving them a reading to delay the reversal. Anna and Tess go to school and spend time in detention for a food fight that Harper and Lily caused at a bake sale, while Harper and Lily enjoy the advantages of being adults and come up with a plan to sabotage the wedding. At a photoshoot of Anna's client, Harper and Lily help the young singer Ella overcome her recent breakup. They learn about Anna's former rock star dreams and find a love song, which they assume Anna wrote about her high school ex-boyfriend Jake Austin. They successfully seek out Jake, but Harper embarrasses herself when unsuccessfully trying to seduce him in Anna's body.

After escaping detention, Anna and Tess find Madame Jen, who reveals Harper and Lily's fortune but warns them that all the four of them need to "change their hearts" in order to change back. Harper, who attends the immigration interview with Eric in Anna's body, realizes how much Eric loves and cares about her. Harper discovers that Eric also thinks it would be the best for their families to stay in Los Angeles, causing Harper to have second thoughts about ruining their wedding. Lily, however, remains determined and invites Jake to the rehearsal dinner. Lily makes a scene in Tess's body, leading to a heated public argument and Eric calling off the wedding.

Following a heartfelt conversation with Tess about her homesickness and the loss of her mother, Lily starts to realize the error of her ways. As Tess, she tries to convince her father not to give up on Anna. At the same time, Anna, followed by Harper, is called to Ella's concert, learning that Ella invited her old band, the Pink Slip, so they could perform together again. Although happy for the reunion, Anna tells Harper she never regretted giving up her musical aspirations because Harper is the best decision she ever made, revealing that the love song was actually written about her. Tess and Lily arrive in time to see it, with Lily happily stating she wants to be a part of this family. With Harper and Lily's change of hearts complete, they all return to their original bodies. Eric arrives to the concert, and he and Anna rekindle their relationship.

The wedding is held the next day. Sometime later, the family attends the launch event of Tess's latest book. Tess is shocked to learn that Lily, while she was in Tess's body, took an unflattering picture of her for the book's cover after applying lip plumper.
