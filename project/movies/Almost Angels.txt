==Plot==
Tony Fiala (played by [[Vincent Winter]]) is a working-class boy whose greatest desire is to become a member of Vienna's most famous choir. His father, however, wants his son to follow in his own footsteps as an engine driver. Unlike his loving and supportive mother, he sees no future for the boy in music.

Despite the objections, Tony manages to join the Vienna Boys' Choir. Once there, he meets Peter (played by [[Sean Scully (actor)|Sean Scully]]), who is the leading chorister and the most experienced solo voice. When Peter finds out that Tony has a wonderful, clear treble voice, he feels threatened by the talented new boy. Peter's jealousy will prompt him to do everything in his power to ruin his rival's public performances and his good image as a boarder, to the point of endangering Tony's life. The sabotage will eventually end but the breaking of Peter's voice will change the events drastically.<ref>[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67127/almost-angels TCM: Almost Angels (1962) - Overview]</ref>
