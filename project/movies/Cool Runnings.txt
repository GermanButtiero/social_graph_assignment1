==Plot==
In November 1987, [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] [[Sprint (running)|sprinter]] Derice Bannock trains to qualify for the [[100-meter dash]] in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|forthcoming Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]]. He fails to advance in the trials when fellow runner Junior Bevil accidentally stumbles and falls, knocking down Derice and another competitor, Yul Brenner.
 
Derice petitions for the race to be rerun, but committee leader Barrington Coolidge denies the request, though he feels pity for Derice. He invites him to try again in four years or to try out for one of the only two other sports Jamaica competes in: boxing and cycling. Derice spots a photograph in Coolidge's office, which shows his late father, Ben, standing next to a fellow Olympic gold medalist. Coolidge identifies the man as Irving "Irv" Blitzer, a former [[bobsled]] champion who was disqualified for cheating in the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo]] and now works as a [[Bookmaker|bookie]] close to Derice's home. Derice realizes he could enter the [[1988 Winter Olympics|upcoming Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]] by forming a bobsled team, recruiting his friend Sanka Coffie, a [[pushcart derby]] champion.
 
Derice and Sanka track down Blitzer, who initially refuses to help Derice but reluctantly agrees to coach the team after learning that he is Ben's son. A recruitment drive fails when only Derice and Sanka stay until the end of a preliminary meeting, but Junior and Yul arrive late, allowing Blitzer to form a four-man team. Junior, like Derice, cannot wait another four years to enter the Olympics, and Yul wants to get off the island. The team trains with Blitzer, though Coolidge refuses to provide the $20,000 needed to participate in the Olympics, believing the team's inexperience will bring disgrace to Jamaica. Derice tries and fails to find sponsors, and he, Sanka, and Yul have little success with a range of fund-raising ventures. Ultimately, Junior sells his car to finance the trip.

Upon reaching Calgary, Blitzer registers the team and borrows a rundown bobsled from Roger, one of his past teammates. The Jamaicans struggle to adapt to the cold and race conditions but improve through exercise and hard work. Derice begins to copy the techniques of the very efficient [[Switzerland at the 1988 Winter Olympics|Swiss team]]. The [[East Germany at the 1988 Winter Olympics|East German team]] and their captain, Josef Groole – the current bobsled world record holder – constantly heckle the Jamaicans during tryouts. Eventually, all the team members except Derice get into a bar fight with the East Germans, and Derice and Irv reprimand them severely afterward, reminding them that they are representing the entire country of Jamaica, and that they need to take things more seriously in order to qualify for the Olympics.

After weeks of training, the team successfully makes the finals, only to be disqualified by the Olympic committee as retribution for Blitzer's prior cheating scandal. Blitzer confronts Kurt Hemphill, his former coach, now a judge in the committee, asking him not to punish the Jamaicans, as they had nothing to do with his past actions. The team is reinstated, and Junior rebuffs his father's attempt to bring him home, firmly stating his intent to remain in Calgary and represent Jamaica.

The team's first day on the track is a disaster, and they finish in last place. Sanka disapproves of Derice copying the Swiss team's methods and encourages them to find their own competition style. They significantly improve on the second day, finishing in eighth place. During their final race, a loose screw causes one of the bobsled's blades to detach, resulting in it flipping over and crashing. Determined to finish the race, the team picks up their bobsled and carries it across the finish line, earning the applause of the other teams and the spectators, including Josef, Kurt and Junior's father, despite their loss. An epilogue explains that the team returned to Jamaica as heroes, and returned to the Winter Olympics [[1992 Winter Olympics|four years later]] to participate as equals.
