PLOT: Ten-year old Emil Tischbein travels by bus from Neustadt to Berlin, carrying an envelope containing 400 marks that his mother has entrusted him to deliver to his grandmother. Emil falls asleep during the bus ride and wakes up to find the money gone. He is sure that the thief is Grundeis, the shifty man who was sitting next to him. Emil follows Grundeis to a Berlin cafe and summons a policeman, but Grundeis escapes to a rendezvous with The Baron, his underworld associate. Emil enlists the help of a group of child "detectives" led by the street urchin Gustav, and together they track down Grundeis and overhear him plotting with The Baron and his accomplice Müller to rob a large Berlin bank by tunneling into its vault. Emil is captured and forced to assist in the criminal plot. After the bank vault is blown open, Grundeis is double-crossed by The Baron and Müller, and left behind with Emil in the tunnel to be blown up by a dynamite fuse - but Gustav arrives in time to save them. The child detectives pursue the thieves and alert more children in the neighborhood, who also give chase. The Baron and Müller are surrounded by the children and arrested by the police. Emil receives a reward, which he intends to share with the other children.
