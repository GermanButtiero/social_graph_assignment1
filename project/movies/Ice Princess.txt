PLOT: In the city of Millbrook, Connecticut, Casey Carlyle, a very smart and talented science student, pursues a scholarship to Harvard University. For the scholarship, she must present a personal summer project about physics. While watching a figure skating competition with her mathematically inclined best friend, Ann, Casey realizes that her favorite childhood hobby, ice skating, would make a perfect project. She decides to try to improve her own skating by applying physics and what she has discovered from watching other skaters.

Following a recital, Casey becomes proficient and skips two levels to become a junior skater. She helps fellow junior skaters Gennifer "Gen" Harwood, Tiffany Lai, and Nikki Fletcher improve their skating by using algorithms generated by her computer. Torn between her Harvard dream and her growing love of skating, Casey has difficulty juggling schoolwork, skating, and a part-time job as a concessions worker; during this time, she develops a relationship with Gen's brother, Teddy. Her mother, Joan, attempts to prevent her from skating due to her declining academic performance. Meanwhile, tension arises between Joan and Gen's mother, Tina, a disgraced former skater who has since become a coach.

Tina, who manages the rink where Casey trains, has Gen on a strict training program. During a competition where both Casey and Gen compete, Tina sees Casey may outrank Gen and sabotages Casey's performance by buying her new skates. Unaware of the danger of unbroken-in skates, Casey's resulting long program is riddled with poor jumps and several falls. Upon being informed of Tina's intent behind her seemingly kind gesture by fellow skate competitor Zoey Bloch, Casey lashes out at her and mistakenly assumes her children were equally involved in the plot. She ranks fifth in the competition but only the top 4 qualify for the sectionals. As a result, Casey loses interest in skating and returns to her studies and goal of attending Harvard.

Upset at her mother's sabotage and frustrated by all the restrictions of training, Gen quits, inadvertently allowing Casey to take her spot. While Casey and Gen reconcile, Casey can now qualify for the sectionals as Gen quit. She declines the Harvard scholarship competition to devote herself to skating, to Joan's dismay. Casey also reconciles with Tina and asks her to be her personal coach and train for the sectionals. Joan, upset at this change of direction in her life, refuses to watch her skate.

At the sectionals, Casey is not fully focused on the competition, and falls while attempting a triple salchow jump. To her surprise, she sees Joan in the audience, having somehow changed her mind. Inspired by this, she gives a highly rated artistic performance. The sectionals ends with Casey placing silver, qualifying to go to Nationals and potentially the 2006 Winter Olympics. Teddy gives Casey flowers to congratulate her, and they kiss. Later, Joan and Tina, despite burying the hatchet as well, bicker about how many college courses Casey should take, the budding love between her and Teddy, her sponsors, and her future in figure skating.
