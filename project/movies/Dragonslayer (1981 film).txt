PLOT: Urland, a sixth-century kingdom near the River Ur, is being terrorized by Vermithrax Pejorative, a 400-year-old dragon. To appease Vermithrax, King Casiodorus offers it virgin girls selected by lottery twice a year. An expedition led by Valerian, a young man, seeks help from the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Cragganmore.

Tyrian, the captain of Casiodorus's Royal Guard, and his lieutenant Jerbul intimidate Ulrich, doubtful of his abilities. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian complies and Ulrich dies. Ulrich's elderly servant Hodge cremates the wizard's body and places the ashes in a leather pouch.

Ulrich's young apprentice Galen Bradwarden is selected by the wizard's magical amulet as its next owner; encouraged, he journeys to Urland. En route, he discovers that Valerian is a young woman disguised to avoid being selected in the lottery. To discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge. Before dying, Hodge hands Galen Ulrich's ashes and reveals that the wizard wanted them spread over a lake of burning water.

In Urland, Galen inspects Vermithrax's lair and magically seals its entrance with a rockslide. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to Casiodorus. Casiodorus disputes that Galen is a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered Vermithrax instead of killing it, as his brother and predecessor once did. Casiodorus confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter, Princess Elspeth, visits Galen, who mentions rumors that the lottery is rigged; it excludes her name and those others whose families are rich enough to bribe Casiodorus into disqualifying their children. Casiodorus cannot lie convincingly when she confronts him over this.

Meanwhile, Vermithrax escapes its prison, causing an earthquake. Galen escapes from his prison, but without the amulet. The village priest, Brother Jacopus, leads his congregation to confront Vermithrax, denouncing it as the Devil. Vermithrax incinerates him and then heads for the village of Swanscombe, burning all in its path.

When the lottery begins anew to placate it, Elspeth rigs the draw so that only her name can be chosen. Desperate, Casiodorus returns the amulet to Galen so that he might save Elspeth. Galen uses the amulet to enchant a spear (forged by Valerian's father and dubbed ''Sicarius Dracorum'', or "Dragonslayer") with the ability to pierce Vermithrax's armored hide. Valerian gathers molted dragon scales to create a shield for Galen. Valerian laments that, her disguise now blown, she will be eligible for the lottery since she is still a virgin. Galen admits that he has fallen in love with her, and the two kiss.

To rescue Elspeth, Galen fights and kills Tyrian. Elspeth, however, wants to make amends for all the girls whose names have been chosen in the past; she descends into Vermithrax's cave and dies. Galen follows her and finds young dragons feasting on her corpse. He slays them and goes on to find Vermithrax resting within an underground lake of fire. He wounds Vermithrax, but the spear's shaft is broken in the battle. Only Valerian's shield saves him from incineration.

After his failure to kill Vermithrax, Valerian convinces Galen to leave Swanscombe with her. As both prepare to depart, the amulet gives Galen a vision of the "burning water" within Vermithrax's cave. Galen realizes that Ulrich planned his own death and cremation, being too old and frail to make the journey himself.

Galen returns to the cave and spreads the ashes over the fiery lake. Ulrich is resurrected. He reveals that his time is short, and that Galen must destroy the amulet "when the time is right". Ulrich then transports himself to a mountaintop, summons a storm and confronts Vermithrax. After a battle, Vermithrax snatches Ulrich and flies away with him. Cued by Ulrich, Galen crushes the amulet with a rock. Ulrich's body explodes and kills Vermithrax, which falls from the sky.

Casiodorus arrives and drives a sword into Vermithrax's carcass to claim the glory for himself while the villagers led by Greil claim God as their hero.  While leaving Urland with Valerian, Galen confesses that he misses both Ulrich and the amulet. He says, "I just wish we had a horse." A white horse then appears, insinuating that the amulet's power is now within Galen. The couple mounts the horse and ride away.
