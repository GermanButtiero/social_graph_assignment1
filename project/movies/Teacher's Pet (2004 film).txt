==Plot==
For the past year, a dog named [[Teacher's Pet (TV series)#Spot Helperman|Spot]] has impersonated a boy named Scott and attended school with his master, fourth-grader [[Teacher's Pet (TV series)#Leonard Helperman|Leonard Helperman]]. Spot desperately wants to become a real human boy, much to the chagrin of Leonard, who just wants a normal dog. Leonard's mother [[Teacher's Pet (TV series)#Mary Lou Helperman|Mary Lou]] is invited to compete in the "Teacher of the Year" finals in Sunny [[Southern Florida]], and granted use of the principal's [[recreational vehicle|RV]] to travel there under the condition that no dogs are allowed. Leonard sadly bids farewell to Spot as they leave him with a pet sitter.

Watching a television talk show, Spot discovers a scientist named Dr. Ivan Krank who claims he can turn animals into human beings and who lives in Southern Florida. Determined to meet Krank and become a boy, Spot chases down the RV, disguises himself as Scott, and convinces Mrs. Helperman to allow him to travel with them.

Back at home, the Helpermans' bird [[Teacher's Pet (TV series)#Pretty Boy|Pretty Boy]] and cat [[Teacher's Pet (TV series)#Mr. Jolly|Mr. Jolly]] learn from a follow-up episode of the talk show that Krank cannot actually turn animals into people, but rather into awkward and grotesque hybrid creatures. Pretty Boy decides they must follow after Spot to warn him, assuring Mr. Jolly that they can be tough despite their size.

Arriving in Florida, Mrs. Helperman heads directly to the Teacher of the Year finals, leaving the boys alone, and Spot convinces Leonard to go with him to Krank's lab. Despite Leonard's apprehensions, Krank agrees to turn Spot human, gleefully anticipating the respect the scientific community has always denied him.

Spot wakes up to find that he is indeed human, but because [[Aging in dogs|dogs age faster than humans]], he is a fully grown man rather than a boy. Krank wants to capture and exhibit the "dog-man" around the world, but they break free. In need of a new wardrobe, "Scott" uses his dog senses to locate a lost dog and claim a cash reward, and he and Leonard enjoy a day on the town.

Scott and Leonard return to the RV to meet Mrs. Helperman, making up a story to explain the disappearance of Scott-the-boy and the appearance of Scott-the-man. Mrs. Helperman invites Scott in for coffee and soon begins to fall for him. Scott considers marrying Leonard's mother so they can all stay together, but Leonard refuses to allow it. Scott angrily states that he is no longer Leonard's dog, and leaves as Leonard takes back his tags and collar.

The other pets arrive in Florida and help Leonard realize that he should support Scott's dream. Leonard concludes that the only way they can all be together is for him to become Scott's dog, and leaves for Krank's lab. A regretful Scott returns to reconcile with Leonard and follows him.

Krank plans to turn Leonard into a dog and capture Scott to exhibit both of them. Scott arrives at the lab and destroys Krank's machine. In the ensuing chaos, the machine turns Krank into a mouse and Scott back to his original dog form. Leonard and Spot reunite, and Spot decides that he is proud to be a dog.
