PLOT: In 1926, New Orleans, a young woman named Tiana dreams of opening a restaurant. She works two waitress jobs to earn money, leaving no time for a social life. Meanwhile, the arrogant Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in town, and intends to marry Tiana's wealthy best friend, Charlotte La Bouff, because his parents have cut him off from the family fortune. Charlotte's father, Big Daddy, hosts a masquerade ball in Naveen's honor. Charlotte asks Tiana to make beignets for the party, paying her enough to buy an old mill to convert into her restaurant. Naveen and his valet, Lawrence, encounter Dr. Facilier, an evil voodoo witch doctor who plans to rule New Orleans. Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog and Lawrence into a doppelganger of Naveen, using a voodoo talisman containing Naveen's blood. Facilier intends for the disguised Lawrence to marry Charlotte, then kill her father with a voodoo doll so he can gain the La Bouff fortune. At the ball, Tiana learns she has been outbid for the mill and accidentally spills food on her outfit, so Charlotte lends her a princess costume. Feeling disheartened, she begins wishing on a star when Naveen appears. Mistaking Tiana for an actual princess, he asks her to kiss him to break the spell, offering her a financial reward. Tiana reluctantly agrees to save her restaurant, but she is instead transformed into a frog as well. The two are chased into a nearby bayou, where they meet a jazz-loving anthropomorphic alligator named Louis. When they explain their predicament, he suggests they seek the help of Mama Odie, another voodoo practitioner who lives in the bayou.

The trio come across a Cajun firefly named Ray who helps them find Mama Odie's abode. During the journey, Tiana and Naveen begin developing romantic feelings for each other, especially after Naveen learns to be more responsible. Meanwhile, when the talisman containing Naveen's blood runs out, Facilier asks his "friends on the other side" (a legion of voodoo spirits) to help retrieve Naveen, offering them the souls of the city's population once he succeeds in taking over, and they grant him an army of shadow demons for his bidding. Mama Odie confirms that only Naveen kissing a princess can break the spell. Tiana realizes that since Charlotte's father has been crowned Mardi Gras king, Charlotte will be a princess until midnight. The group hitches a ride on a steamboat back to New Orleans, during which Naveen tells Ray about his love for Tiana and plans to propose marriage to her. After talking to Tiana, Naveen selflessly decides against proposing, since transforming him and Tiana into humans and financing Tiana's restaurant is contingent on him kissing Charlotte. The shadow demons capture Naveen and bring him to Facilier to replenish the talisman with Naveen's blood. After Ray tells Tiana of Naveen's love for her, Tiana heads to the Mardi Gras parade to find Naveen, only to see the disguised Lawrence marrying Charlotte.

Ray rescues the real Naveen and steals the talisman, but is mortally wounded by Facilier, who then offers to make Tiana's dream come true in exchange for the talisman. Refusing to dishonor her father, Tiana destroys the talisman, leading the voodoo spirits to drag Facilier into their world for failing to pay back his debt. After Lawrence is arrested, Tiana reveals her love to Naveen. Charlotte agrees to kiss Naveen, but the clock strikes midnight before she can do so. Ray dies and is reincarnated as a star during his funeral. Tiana and Naveen are wed by Mama Odie and then restored to human form when they kiss, since Tiana is now truly a princess. They return to New Orleans and open their restaurant, named Tiana's Palace.
