PLOT: In Inveranoch, Scotland, in the year 1912, veterinarian Andrew MacDhui lives with his seven-year-old daughter Mary and her cat Thomasina, who narrates the film in voiceover. MacDhui is a widower whose wife's death destroyed his belief in God and his empathy for others. When Thomasina contracts tetanus after a scuffle near the fish market goes wrong, MacDhui orders his assistant Willie Bannock to euthanize her. Willie reminds MacDhui that he promised Mary to make Thomasina well again, but he is so preoccupied with his surgery on another patient's seeing eye dog that he ignores the plea. Traumatised by Thomasina's death, Mary withdraws emotionally from MacDhui and declares her father dead, refusing to speak to or look at him.

Thomasina's soul goes to a feline afterlife and meets the Egyptian cat goddess Bastet. Since Thomasina still has eight lives left, Bastet returns her to her body.

Mary and her friends take Thomasina's body beyond the town for a funeral, but they are frightened by the appearance of "Mad Lori" MacGregor, a young woman who lives in the glen and was attracted by the children's singing and bagpipe playing. The children believe she is a witch because of her apparent power to calm and cure animals. Lori brings Thomasina back to her makeshift animal hospital. Although the cat recovers, she has no memory of her life with Mary. Thus begins her second life.

The townspeople are disappointed by MacDhui's lack of compassion, so they begin taking their sick pets to Lori instead. MacDhui visits Lori with the intention of confronting her for stealing his business, but instead they both realize that they each have half of what is needed to treat sick animals: he has the science and surgical knowledge; she has the love and compassion.  By working together, they are able to save a badger whose right rear leg has been injured by a trap.

As Thomasina's memory is slowly returning, she realizes she misses something very important, but she cannot recall what. She remembers the way back home, but does not recognize Mary, who chases her into a rainstorm. Thomasina returns to the safety of Lori's cabin in the woods. Mary contracts pneumonia, and her father finds her lying on the street in the rain.

A Romani group sets up camp in town and opens their travelling circus. When MacDhui and Lori discover the Romani have been abusing their performing animals (for instance, a dancing Asiatic black bear), they visit the circus. Their attempt at discussion leads to a fight and, eventually, a fire. The police arrest the proprietors for animal cruelty.

MacDhui prays for the first time in four years that God will somehow cure his daughter.  Off in the glen, a lightning bolt strikes a tree next to Thomasina, and her memory is suddenly restored. Thomasina returns to the MacDhui home. MacDhui places her in his daughter's arms, and this restores Mary's will to live — as well as her love for her father. Lori's love has changed MacDhui. They make a perfect veterinary team, and they soon marry. Thomasina begins her third life with all of them together.
