==Plot==
In the [[Wild West]] in 1879, a slick gambler named Russell Donovan comes to the town of Quake City en route to open a casino in [[New Orleans]]. There, he meets his old associate, John Wintle, who is leaving for [[San Francisco]] and asks Donovan to sign for valuables coming in on the next day's [[stagecoach]]. Donovan accepts a down payment and promises to pick them up. The next day, he realizes he has been duped into taking care of three little orphans named Bobby, Clovis, and Celia Bradley. The stagecoach driver, Magnolia "Dusty" Clydesdale, explains that Wintle is in fact their relative and legal guardian. With him gone and Donovan promising to care for the "valuables", they are now his wards. The town's [[sheriff]], [[barber]], and [[justice of the peace]], Homer McCoy, tells him that he is legally obligated unless he can have someone else take custody of them. The children cause Donovan much grief by offending all prospective new guardians. They wreak havoc in Quake City while riding in an old mine cart, destroying much private property. The townspeople demand that Donovan pay for the damage, costing him most of his funds for his trip to New Orleans.

Donovan becomes the target of Amos Tucker and Theodore Ogelvie, former members of the Stillwell Gang who were ousted by their former boss, Frank Stillwell, for shooting him in the leg. They continuously try to rob Donovan during his stay in town with unsuccessful results.

The children decide to help Donovan earn money by going to the gold mine that they inherited. They encounter Amos and Theodore at their hideout, who direct the children to the mine after mistaking them for a posse. The children discover a massive gold nugget in the mine, which incentivizes many people to adopt them as it would give them access to the gold. Fearing that these people would not have the children's best interests at heart, Donovan arranges a sham marriage with Dusty so she can keep custody of them while he goes to New Orleans. However, complications arise when Wintle returns. He heard of the nugget and schemes to regain custody of the children. His attorney has a court order demanding their immediate return. McCoy is forced to adhere to his demands.

At the same time, Amos and Theodore attempt to steal the nugget from the local bank and escape to Mexico, but are unsuccessful. McCoy finds them guilty of attempted robbery and sentences them to hang to scare them out of town. They flee to their hideout.

The Stillwell Gang enters town and plans to steal the nugget. Stillwell impersonates a priest to gain more information about the transportation of the nugget from Colonel T.R. Clydesdale, whom he coerces into disclosing the time and place the nugget will be moved. The children, who have grown attached to Donovan and Dusty, go to Amos and Theodore and give them permission to steal the nugget. If it goes missing, Wintle will have no more desire for the children and will return custody. The next day, the Stillwell Gang enters the bank and takes the nugget. Simultaneously, the children help Amos and Theodore rob the bank. They are recognized by Stillwell and almost killed. They are saved when one of the Stillwell Gang members starts a shootout with the lawmen and distracts Stillwell. He decides to leave the nugget and escape, taking Celia as a hostage. Donovan saves her with help from Dusty and they realize their love for each other. Amos and Theodore retreat to the bank's safe to escape from gunfire. Their dynamite is shot by one of the townspeople, obliterating the bank, and the nugget gets blown into many smaller nuggets.

Wintle renounces his guardianship and leaves town. Stillwell's bounty is awarded to Donovan, giving him enough money for his casino in New Orleans. He buys a ranch for himself, Dusty, and the children instead. On their way to the ranch, a reformed Amos and Theodore catch up with the newfound family asking for work as farmhands, to which Donovan agrees.
