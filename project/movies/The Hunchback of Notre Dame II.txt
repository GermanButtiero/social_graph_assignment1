PLOT: Six years after becoming an accepted member of Parisian society, Quasimodo has inherited the mantle as Paris' Minister of Justice from his deceased master Judge Claude Frollo, but still lives in Notre-Dame de Paris with his gargoyle friends: Victor, Hugo, and Laverne as its bell ringer. Meanwhile, Captain Phoebus and Esmeralda are now married and have a son named Zephyr who has a close friendship with Quasimodo.

A circus troupe called Cirque de Sarousch comes as part of an event called Le Jour d'Amour where romance is celebrated and couples declare their love. Unbeknownst to anyone, the members of the circus troupe are thieves who steal from their audiences. The owner named Sarousch plans to steal Notre Dame's most beloved bell, La Fidèle. The inside is decorated with beige-gold and enormous jewels. He sends an aspiring high-wire girl named Madellaine to pretend to love Quasimodo in order to discover the whereabouts of La Fidèle. She meets Quasimodo without seeing his face. They get along quite well, but when she sees his face, she runs away. Victor, Hugo, and Laverne convince him to go to the circus in order to see her again. At the circus, Sarousch captures the audience's attention by making an elephant disappear while his subordinates steal from the audience. After the magic show, Madellaine tells him that she does not want to be part of his scheme anymore but he reminds her of her past: when she was six years old, she was an orphan who he caught trying to steal money from him. He could have reported her to the authorities, but decided to employ her in exchange for food and somewhere to live instead. When she sees Quasimodo playing with Zephyr, she ceases to be scared of his appearance. He takes her sightseeing around Paris, but a thunderstorm forces them to go inside Notre Dame. He takes the opportunity to give her a figurine of her that he created. She kisses him on the forehead and leaves. This causes him to faint out of happiness.

The next day, he goes to Esmeralda for advice because he feels weird. She realizes that he is in love with Madellaine and tells him that he needs to confess his feelings. When Phoebus reveals that he has discovered a connection between reports of robberies in the city and the circus, this makes Quasimodo, Esmerelda, and Zephyr angry with him because Quasimodo does not think that Madellaine is involved, Esmerelda thinks that he carries prejudice against the Romani, and Zephyr likes the circus. Sarousch threatens Madellaine that he will kill Quasimodo unless she keeps him occupied while he and his men steal La Fidèle. Phoebus questions him about the robberies and finds a stolen jewel. Realizing that he can use this to his advantage, he lies that Madellaine is a lifelong thief and he is covering for her crimes. While Quasimodo and Madellaine go for a walk, Sarousch and two of his subordinates sneak into Notre Dame. Victor, Hugo, and Laverne try to stop the thieves, but they get trapped under another bell. Zephyr and Djali who watch Sarousch make La Fidèle disappear decide to learn where he is taking it. Laverne bangs her head against the bell in order to alert everyone outside.

After the new Archdeacon reveals that La Fidèle has been stolen, Phoebus realizes that Sarousch tricked him and sends his soldiers around Paris. Quasimodo accuses Madellaine of never loving him and breaks off their relationship before Phoebus has her arrested. He frees Victor, Hugo, and Laverne who tell him that Zephyr is pursuing Sarousch. While the thieves take La Fidèle through the Catacombs of Paris, they discover Zephyr and Djali who have stowed away on their boat. Djali manages to escape from them and goes through a tunnel. When Madellaine reveals that Sarousch has taken La Fidèle underground, Phoebus decides to search around the catacombs and reluctantly brings Madellaine. In the Catacombs, the search party encounters Djali who leads them to the thieves and Zephyr. Sarousch has taken Zephyr hostage and blackmails Phoebus into opening a gate for him. After Madellaine pleads with Quasimodo to trust her, he lassos a rock in order to create a tightrope that she walks across. She uses her high-wire skills in order to rescue Zephyr and reunite him with his parents. Sarousch and his men are given a life sentence in prison for his crimes.

During Le Jour d'Amour, a number of romantic couples including Phoebus and Esmeralda declare their love while Quasimodo rings La Fidèle. He and Madellaine declare their own love and share their first kiss while Zephyr rings La Fidèle.
