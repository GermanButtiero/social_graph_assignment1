==Plot==
Texas [[cowboy]], Lincoln Costain ([[James Garner]]), gets "[[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]]" in San Francisco, then jumps ship and washes ashore on the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai]], right into the arms of widow Henrietta MacAvoy ([[Vera Miles]]) and her son ([[Eric Shea]]) who are struggling to make a living as farmers.  A lot of wild cattle often trample their crops, so Costain gets the idea to start cattle ranching instead. The Hawaiian farm hands don't readily take to the American [[cowboy]] culture, and Calvin Bryson ([[Robert Culp]]), is a banker with eyes to grab Henrietta's land and maybe Henrietta herself.
