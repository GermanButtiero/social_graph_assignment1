== Plot ==
Tony and his sister Tia need a vacation. Uncle Bené drops them off in their [[flying saucer]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] in Los Angeles, California, after which the siblings quickly become separated from each other. A man named Dr. Victor Gannon and his assistant Letha Wedge witness Tony using his powers to save Letha's nephew Sickle from certain death. Realizing that Tony has supernatural powers, Dr. Gannon drugs the boy with a tranquilizer shot and takes him back to their laboratory. There, Dr. Gannon successfully tests a new mind-control technology on him. Under its influence, Tony is completely hypnotized and does everything his kidnappers want him to do, including stealing gold from a museum exhibit and stopping Tia from finding them. With Tony at his robotic bidding, Dr. Gannon hopes to achieve recognition within the scientific community and worldwide power, while Letha merely wants a return on her investment.

The Earthquake Gang, a group of would-be tough boys Tia meets, are being chased by a group of rivals; Tia telepathically gets rid of them. The boys accept her into their ranks and help her look for her brother. They let her sleep in their secret hideout, where she has visions of Tony's location.

Tia sees Tony at work with gold in a museum; he is controlled by a chip attached to his ear. To go to him, Tia convinces the Earthquake gang to "turn themselves in" to Mr. Yokomoto, the [[truant]] officer, who Tia informs about her brother. Yokomoto agrees that the brother should also go to school, so chases the doctor, aunt, nephew, and Tony in his minibus. While chasing them, Gannon has Tony try measures to elude the pursuer, and ultimately cause the minibus to go out of control. Tia and the gang hurry away to find Tony, leaving Mr. Yokomoto realizing he will lose his job for destroying public property.

Tony unstacks the gold for Letha, but her pushy desire for speed damages Letha's van.

Using her telepathy to find Tony, Tia discovers his captors' hideout but is caught by Sickle and placed in an anesthesia chamber by Gannon. Unable to move, Tia telepathically asks a goat to find the Earthquake Gang. The gang follows the goat back to the hideout and they free Tia as Tony, Letha, Sickle, and Victor drive to a plant to steal plutonium. Tia traces their location and describes it as a "big round ball". They come across Mr. Yokomoto, who tells them he lost his job and the only thing that works in the minibus is the radio. The news given about the plutonium plant stresses on the term "molecular flow".

Tia then asks Mr. Yokomoto to drive them to the location after she telekinetically repairs the minibus so it will at least run. After Victor and his gang reach the site, he shuts down the plant's cooling system. In exchange for turning it back on, he demands $5 million in cash (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|5|1978|r=0}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), a jet to escape, and public acknowledgement of his achievements. The people working at the plant make arrangements for the money as soon as possible, but Tia reaches the site in time, where she and Tony battle to turn on the cooling system. Tia manages to turn it on, but Victor commands Tony to kill his sister. Tia realizes he is being controlled and destroys the device. Tony levitates Victor, Sickle and Letha to the ceiling with no way of getting down. Mr. Yokomoto drives the kids to the Rose Bowl Stadium and the Earthquake Gang come along to say goodbye. Tony and Tia restore the minibus to mint condition (so Mr. Yokomoto will not lose his job), convince the gang of the value of going to school, bid farewell to them, board the flying saucer and go back to Witch Mountain.
