==Plot==
Set in the late 1580s, the film very loosely follows the real-life exploits of the 16th-century Irish prince [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell|Hugh Roe "Red Hugh" O'Donnell]]. The story begins when Hugh's father, the [[Chief of the Name]], dies, leaving his son as Chief of [[O'Donnell dynasty|Clan O'Donnell]]. With his accession to the throne, an Irish [[prophecy]] is seemingly fulfilled which promises independence from [[Elizabethan]] and [[English people|English rule]]. In response, the Queen's Lord Lieutenant abducts him and imprisons him in [[Dublin Castle]] as a hostage for the Clan's good behavior. After a daring escape, he flies across Ireland with the sons of [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh Roe O'Neill]].

The O'Donnell lords see this occurrence as the opportunity to strike back at the foreigners by force, but Hugh convinces them the right plan is to band together with the other [[Irish clans|clans]] of the island, and bargain for their freedom from a position of strength. As he prepares for battle, O'Donnell also courts the beautiful Kathleen McSweeney, to further augment the clans of Ireland.
