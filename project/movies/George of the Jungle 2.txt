PLOT: Six years after socialite Ursula Stanhope left civilization to marry George of the Jungle, George has fathered George Jr. and finds himself hard-pressed to fulfill the roles of jungle king, father, and husband.

George's stress level increases when "Mean Lion" challenges him for leadership of the jungle, and when Ursula's mother Beatrice teams up with Ursula's ex-fiancé, Lyle van de Groot, in a plot to bring Ursula and George Jr. back to civilization. Beatrice invites Ursula, George, and George Jr. to visit Las Vegas, which they accept. Throughout the visit, Beatrice and Ursula's fellow socialites try to convince Ursula that George is unworthy of her affection. George, observing the threats but not his wife's resistance, begins to think himself unworthy of Ursula.

George's mentor Ape has accumulated gambling debts to several creditors, including Lyle. Upon discovering that Ape does not own Ape Mountain, but George does, Lyle makes Ape work off his debts for the next 17 years. He then engages Ape as a staged song performer and steals the deed to Ape Mountain from George's wardrobe. He sends two agents, Sally and Kowalski, to Ape Mountain, where they begin to demolish the jungle. The animals, terrified, turn to the Lion for guardianship.

Having failed to convince Ursula to leave George, Beatrice hires Armando, a master of hypnosis to hypnotize Ursula into having no memory of George and believing Lyle is her husband. George, upon hearing from Beatrice that Ursula has left him, leaves his luck-charm with Ursula as she sleeps, then departs. Tookie informs George about the jungle demolition and Mean Lion's revolt, so George convinces Ape to leave Las Vegas with him, eluding capture by Sally, Kowalski, casino security guards, police helicopter pilots, and animal control officers.

In San Francisco, Lyle fails to persuade Ursula that he is worthy of her affection. George arrives, determined to win Ursula and George Jr. back before saving the jungle. Ursula insists she must be loyal to her marriage vows to Lyle. After accidentally knocking her unconscious, George returns home with her, Ape, George Jr., and Rocky the kangaroo. George overthrows Mean Lion and convinces the other African animals to join him in stopping the diggers. George defeats the bulldozers with the help of George Jr., Ape, Shep, Rocky, and Tookie.

Lyle's agents Sally and Kowalski come to destroy the tree house only to be defeated by George and Rocky. George Jr. shuts off the digging machine. Lyle and Beatrice arrive to pick up Ursula and George Jr. George defeats Lyle and hangs him in a tree. George kisses Ursula, restoring her full memory of him, and Beatrice is kissed by a gorilla. A defeated Lyle takes his anger out on the Narrator by insulting him. In response, the Narrator grabs him and removes him from the story. After George kisses Ursula's friends (for they had been hypnotized into forgetting George also), George and Ursula renew their wedding vows and learn to find balance among George's duties.
