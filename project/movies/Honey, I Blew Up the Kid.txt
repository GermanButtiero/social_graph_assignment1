<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
Three years after the events of the [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids|first film]], inventor Wayne Szalinski has moved to [[Nevada]] with his wife Diane and their children. Their older son Nick is now a 14-year-old teenager, their 18-year-old daughter Amy is preparing to leave for college, and their younger son, Adam, is two years old. When Diane leaves with Amy to help her settle into her college dorm, Wayne and Nick are left in charge of Adam. The three of them go to Sterling Labs, where Wayne has constructed a version of his [[shrink ray]] machine which enlarges objects. He tests it on Adam's favorite toy, Big Bunny. When Wayne and Nick are distracted, Adam is zapped by the machine, which short-circuits and does not enlarge Big Bunny.

Back home, Adam and Big Bunny are exposed to electrical waves from the microwave oven and grow to a height of seven feet. Wayne and Nick take Adam back to the lab to reverse the growth process, but are kicked out by Wayne's colleague, Dr. Charles Hendrickson, who wants control of Wayne's invention. Diane returns home and joins Wayne and Nick as they struggle to prevent Adam from demolishing the house. In another attempt to shrink Adam back to normal size, Wayne and Diane retrieve Wayne's original shrink ray machine from a warehouse. Meanwhile, a girl named Mandy arrives to babysit Adam, but faints when she sees him. Nick, who has a crush on Mandy, ties up and gags her to prevent her from alerting the neighbors to Adam's condition. As Nick explains the situation to Mandy, Adam is exposed to the television's electrical waves and grows to fourteen feet before escaping through a wall.

Nick and Mandy search for Adam, but are taken into custody, while Adam is confined in a truck. Wayne and Diane return home to find Hendrickson and a US Marshal waiting for them. Hendrickson has summoned Clifford Sterling, the company chairman, hoping he will fire Wayne, but Sterling fires Hendrickson instead. Meanwhile, the truck carrying Adam passes by high-voltage power lines, causing him to grow to fifty feet. He escapes confinement and puts Nick and Mandy in his overalls pocket, mistaking them for toys. He then heads towards [[Las Vegas]], pursued by his parents and the authorities. As Wayne and Sterling realize that exposure to the neon lights of the city will make him grow even larger, Hendrickson devises a plan to sedate Adam with [[tranquilizer gun|tranquilizer cartridges]].

Now over a hundred feet tall, Adam causes mass panic as he wanders through Las Vegas. Wayne attempts various plans such as attempting to put him to sleep with Big Bunny by helicopter, and the US Marshal attempting to lure him from the city with an ice cream truck, which all fail. Finally, Diane deduces he only recognizes items smaller than himself as toys, and he will behave if she was to be enlarged as well, before convincing Wayne to use the shrink ray to grow her to colossal size. Hendrickson arrives by helicopter and starts firing tranquilizer darts at Adam, who is carrying the neon guitar sign of a [[Hard Rock Cafe]]. The sign is hit by a dart and releases an electrical charge which causes Adam to cry, leaving the crowd pitying rather than fearing him. Hendrickson is stopped by a giant Diane, who then comforts Adam and holds him still while Wayne shrinks them both back to normal size. When Hendrickson arrives to reluctantly congratulate Wayne, Diane knocks him out with a punch for hurting Adam. Wayne and Diane then realize that Nick and Mandy are now tiny, since they were in Adam's pocket when he was shrunk. Wayne finds them, but gives them a few minutes of privacy since they are having a romantic moment.
