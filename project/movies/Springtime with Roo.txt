==Plot==
On [[Easter]] day in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]], [[Roo]] and his friends [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]], [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]], [[Tigger]], and [[Eeyore]] visit [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]]'s house, where they expect to celebrate Easter. Upon arrival, the friends discover that Rabbit has replaced the Easter celebration with a [[Spring cleaning|Spring Cleaning]] Day. 

In Rabbit's absence, the group discover that all of their Easter ornaments had been hidden in Rabbit's closet. Assuming that Rabbit had simply forgotten about Easter, the gang decide to surprise Rabbit by decorating his house with the ornaments, but once Rabbit discovers this, he angrily kicks everyone out of his home for disobeying his orders.

Seeing Roo saddened over the events, Tigger returns to Rabbit's house to try reasoning with him. Still upset with his friends, Rabbit insists that Easter will never be celebrated in the Hundred Acre Wood again. Confused as to why Rabbit no longer likes Easter, Tigger and the story's [[David Ogden Stiers|narrator]] take Rabbit back through the book to last Easter's celebration, which was sometime after [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]] and Roo had moved to the Hundred Acre Wood.

On that day, Rabbit had insisted on an organized Easter party, but his strict behavior annoyed everyone to the point that Tigger led the group into sneaking away to celebrate Easter without Rabbit, leaving him feeling left out. Embittered by the past, Rabbit continues to disallow Easter.

Tigger returns to the present and informs his friends of the reason behind Rabbit's banning of Easter, causing Roo to sympathize with Rabbit. Meanwhile, Rabbit also returns to the present, but the Narrator purposefully stops on the wrong page, where Rabbit finds Kanga and Roo's house and overhears Roo stating his wish to cheer Rabbit up, though this fails to change Rabbit's mind. Frustrated with Rabbit's stubbornness, the Narrator transports him to the future, where Rabbit's Spring Cleaning Day celebration has been organized just as he wanted. However, Rabbit is horrified to learn that all of his friends have left the Hundred Acre Wood, causing him to realize the consequences of his selfishness.

Rabbit wakes up the next morning to realize that the events were just a dream and that he still has a chance to change the future. Meanwhile, Roo decides to cheer Rabbit up by repairing his Easter hat, which the latter had damaged yesterday in his frustration. While Roo and his friends work on their surprise, Rabbit arrives at Roo's house to reveal that he has prepared a bigger and better Easter celebration, thrilling everyone as they all participate in the festivities.
