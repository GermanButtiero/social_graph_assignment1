In [[14th century]] [[Europe]], King Stefan and Queen Leah{{efn|The Queen is unnamed in the film, likely due to her minor role.{{sfn|Smith|2012|page=35}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Dave|author-link=Dave Smith (archivist)|title=Ask the Walt Disney Archives|url=https://d23.com/ask-dave/jeremy-singapore-singapore/|website=[[D23 (Disney)|D23]]|access-date=July 11, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711153523/https://d23.com/ask-dave/jeremy-singapore-singapore/|archive-date=July 11, 2024|url-status=live}}</ref> She is referred to as Leah in the film's 1993 book adaptation by [[Peter Lerangis|A. L. Singer]].{{sfn|Singer|1993|page=5}}}} welcome their newborn daughter, [[Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|Aurora]], and proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess. At her [[Baptism|christening]], she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of Stefan's friend King Hubert, in order to [[Jure uxoris|unite their kingdoms]]. The three [[Fairy|good fairies]], [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]], each bless Aurora with one gift. After Flora and Fauna give her beauty and song, the evil fairy [[Maleficent]] appears, angry at not being invited. She places a [[curse]] on Aurora: before the sun sets on Aurora's sixteenth birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] of a [[spinning wheel]] and die. Merryweather's magic isn't strong enough to undo the curse, so she uses her gift to change it so that Aurora will instead fall into a deep sleep until [[true love's kiss]] breaks the spell.

Still fearful, Stefan orders all the kingdom's spinning wheels to be burned. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather devise a plan to hide Aurora in a secluded location and raise her themselves until her sixteenth birthday, to which Stefan and Leah reluctantly agree. The fairies move into a forest [[cottage]], giving up magic and living like human [[peasant]]s; they also rename Aurora to Briar Rose.

On Aurora's sixteenth birthday, the fairies send her to gather berries so they can prepare a surprise party. In the forest, Aurora sings to her [[animal]] friends, drawing the attention of Phillip, now a handsome young man. They fall in love without revealing their names, and Aurora invites Phillip to the cottage that evening. Meanwhile, Flora and Merryweather's argument about the color of Aurora's birthday gown attracts the attention of Maleficent's pet [[raven]], Diablo.{{efn|The raven's name is not mentioned in the film. He was referred to as Diablo by the animators during the film's production.<ref name="12ThingsToKnow">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/sleeping-beauty-art-of-disney-animation/|title=12 Things to Know about 'Sleeping Beauty' and the Art of Disney Animation|last=Radish|first=Christina|date=October 18, 2014|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|access-date=January 20, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230120120507/https://collider.com/sleeping-beauty-art-of-disney-animation/|archive-date=January 20, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref>}} Aurora returns and tells her guardians that she has fallen in love. They reveal her true identity, which Diablo overhears, and tell her that she must never see the boy again. Meanwhile, Phillip tells his father about the girl he met and wants to marry, unaware she is the princess to whom he is betrothed. King Hubert unsuccessfully tries to dissuade him.

Shortly before sunset, the fairies bring Aurora to the [[castle]] for her birthday celebration. Maleficent appears as a [[Will-o'-the-wisp|glowing ball of light]] and hypnotically beckons Aurora to a tower room, where Aurora pricks her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel that Maleficent conjures and falls into a deep sleep. The fairies place the sleeping Aurora in the highest tower, and put the entire kingdom to sleep until Aurora is awakened. While doing so, Flora overhears a conversation between Hubert and Stefan, and realizes that Phillip is the boy that Aurora met. The fairies rush to the cottage, only to discover that Phillip has been abducted by Maleficent.

At her domain, the Forbidden Mountain, Maleficent reveals Aurora's identity to Phillip. She plans to lock him away until he is an old man on the verge of death before releasing him to meet Aurora, who will not have aged a single day. The fairies rescue Phillip and arm him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue. Maleficent surrounds Stefan's castle with a forest of [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns]], but Phillip breaks through it. Outraged, she transforms into a giant, fire-breathing [[dragon]], overpowering Phillip. The fairies enchant Phillip's sword, which he throws straight into Maleficent's heart, killing her.

Phillip finds Aurora and awakens her with a kiss, bringing the rest of the kingdom out of their slumber. The two descend to the ballroom, where Aurora reunites with her parents and happily dances with Phillip as the good fairies look on with joy.
