PLOT: In 1974, Skeeter and Wendy Bronson are raised by their father Marty at the family business, the Sunny Vista Motel. However, despite being a good hotelier and host, Marty faces serious financial problems with the family motel business and almost goes bankrupt. Marty sells the motel to his good friend Barry Nottingham,  the severely germaphobic CEO and founder of hotel chain Nottingham Hotels, in a forced liquidation who rebuilds and renovates it into a luxury hotel named the Sunny Vista Nottingham, on the condition that Skeeter will run it when he's old enough. 34 years later, Skeeter is stuck as the hotel's hardworking repairman. Nottingham announces plans to close the old hotel in order to build a bigger one, named the Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham, and appoints the snotty Kendall Duncan as its future manager, simply because he is dating Nottingham's daughter, Violet, though he is secretly having an affair with the hotel manager Aspen.

Wendy asks Skeeter to watch her children, Patrick and Bobbi, because the school at which she is the principal is closing down and she is looking for a job in Arizona. The first night, Skeeter cynically tells them a bedtime story in which he casts himself as an underdog peasant in a medieval fantasy world, who is unfairly passed over for promotion. Dissatisfied with the story’s unhappy ending, the children add that he at least gets a chance at the promotion and that it starts raining gumballs.

The next day, the story miraculously comes true: Nottingham, recalling the original promise he made to Marty, gives Skeeter a shot at the manager position; and on his way home, gumballs rain on Skeeter from a truck crash on an overpass. The next night, at the hotel, Skeeter tells a wild west-style story in which he, as a cowboy, is freely given an expensive horse named Ferrari. Going out later that night, he saves Violet from obnoxious paparazzi; he then sees Violet’s Ferrari car and mistakenly thinks it is for him before Violet drives away. Skeeter realizes that only the children's additions to the stories come true. The night after that, Skeeter, with the children's help, tells a story about a chariot-riding stuntman in Ancient Greece who wins a date with the “fairest maiden in the land”. The next day, Skeeter ends up spending the day with and falling for his sister's friend and colleague Jill.

On Skeeter’s last night with the children, he tells them a space opera-style story in which he triumphs over Kendall in a duel. The children, recalling how Skeeter told them on their first night that there are no happy endings in real life, add that someone kills him with a fireball. Skeeter and Kendall both make presentations on how best to market the hotel; with his heartfelt speech on family, Skeeter ultimately wins the managerial position. However, Skeeter learns from Kendall that the new Nottingham Hotel will be at the location of the closing school and, paranoid against fire due to the story, blasts a fire extinguisher at Nottingham's cake and is “fired”.

Skeeter, much to the surprise of Jill and Nottingham manages to get the hotel’s location moved to the beachfront in Santa Monica; after which Skeeter and Jill race to the school before it can be demolished. While at the site, protesting the school’s closure, Bobbi and Patrick sneak into the building to give their sign a better view. Skeeter and Jill arrive just in time to stop Kendall from setting off the highly sensitive explosives, saving the kids and the school. Sometime later, Skeeter marries Jill and opens a motel named after his father; with Kendall and Aspen demoted to the motel's waiting staff. Violet marries Skeeter's best friend, Mickey, giving him control of the Nottingham Empire. Nottingham overcomes his extreme germaphobia, quitting the hotel industry to become a school nurse, and newlywed Skeeter and Jill have a baby boy.
