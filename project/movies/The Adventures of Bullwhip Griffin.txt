PLOT: In 1849, Jack and Arabella Flagg are orphaned in Boston. Along with the family's former butler, Eric Griffin, they stow away aboard a ship bound for San Francisco, where the gold rush has begun. Eric gets work as the ship's cook.

Judge Higgins, a swindler and thief, steals a map to a gold mine belonging to Quentin Bartlett, an actor who is among the ship's passengers. Eric, Jack, and Quentin pursue the crooked judge. Arabella arrives in town and takes a job in a dance hall to make ends meet.

Eric encounters a stocky bully, Mountain Ox, and lashes out a punch that flattens him. "Bullwhip" becomes his new nickname. Inspired by the incident, Bullwhip enters a prizefighting match and wins the money. He also wins Arabella's affection. Judge Higgins, caught trying to steal the fight's receipts, quivers behind bars as a lynch mob forms outside. The ensuing riot causes a fire that burnt down much of the town, but Bullwhip uses his prizefighting winnings to rebuild the town better than before, making him a local hero.
