==Plot==
Lieutenant Jordan, [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]], responds to a number of pleas for help from civilian pleasure boat sailors around Southern California's [[Balboa Island, Newport Beach|Balboa Island]]. This type of event is typical of what the Coast Guard deals with on a regular basis, and it is one of the reasons why Jordan has requested to transfer to a new station. He is handing over the reins to [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Tom Garland, a polite but remarkably clumsy fellow who will now report to [[Commander]] Taylor, a man who fought in [[World War II]] with Garland's father and holds him in high regard.

Garland's ineptitude as the new skipper of the cutter ''Point Maley'' is revealed. He repeatedly mishandles various minor issues plaguing impatient travelers on the crowded waterways. Despite his growing reputation, he quickly falls for Kate Fairchild, manager of a local boat rental and sailing school. In their initial meeting, Garland accidentally dumps a can of paint on her head.

A trio of jewel thieves are making their way to Mexico while pursued by authorities. Ringleader Harry Simmons poses as a yacht club commodore and dispatches orders to his two associates, Charlie and Max, as they prepare to smuggle stolen jewels inside an assortment of hollowed food. They rent a boat from Kate, although none of them know how to sail. A picnic hamper with the jewel-laden food falls overboard and the trio makes repeated unsuccessful attempts to retrieve it.

They finally hire a professional pearl diver, Chiyoko Kuni, who appears not to speak English but does recover the goods. Then, in perfect English, she demands many times the agreed fee.

After witnessing their suspicious behavior, Kate and Tom suspect that the trio are the three men sought by police. Commander Taylor does not believe it. Ultimately, Tom is able to convince Taylor to retrieve the stolen jewels and ensure that the jewel thieves are arrested.
