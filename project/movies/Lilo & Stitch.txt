On planet Turo, the United Galactic Federation convicts Dr. Jumba Jookiba of illegal genetic experimentation; he has created [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|Experiment 626]], an aggressive and near-indestructible creature with advanced learning capabilities. Experiment 626 is escorted by Captain Gantu for [[exile]], but 626 escapes and hijacks a space cruiser that crash-lands on [[Kaua{{okina}}i]], [[Hawaii]], on the planet [[Earth]]. Shortly after landing on Earth, 626 is run over by three passing trucks and taken to an [[animal shelter]]. The Federation's Grand Councilwoman offers Jumba an early release if he retrieves 626 with the assistance of the council's Earth expert, Agent Pleakley.

On Kaua{{okina}}i, orphaned teenager Nani Pelekai struggles to take care of her lonely, rambunctious younger sister, Lilo, following their parents' death in a [[car crash]]. Social worker Cobra Bubbles doubts Nani can be an adequate [[Legal guardian|guardian]] for Lilo, and threatens to place Lilo in [[foster care]] if the Pelekais' situation fails to improve within three days. After overhearing Lilo wishing for a friend, Nani brings her to the animal shelter to adopt a dog. Lilo adopts 626, who is impersonating a dog, and names him "Stitch". Jumba and Pleakley disguise themselves as tourists while trying to capture Stitch. When Stitch attacks Pleakley at the [[lū{{okina}}au]] where Nani works, Nani is blamed for the incident and fired. Bubbles orders Nani to find a new job and tells Lilo to teach Stitch to be a "model citizen".

Despite Lilo's attempts to domesticate Stitch, his antics repeatedly ruin Nani's efforts to find a new job. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch go [[surfing]] with Nani's friend and former co-worker David, Jumba and Pleakley again attempt to capture Stitch, who unintentionally drags Lilo under water. David rescues Lilo and Stitch, but Bubbles, having observed the mishap, tells Nani he will retrieve Lilo the following morning. Feeling guilty for causing so much trouble, Stitch runs away. Having failed to capture Stitch, the Grand Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley, and tasks Gantu with capturing Stitch. Now free, Jumba begins hunting Stitch using less-covert methods. When David informs Nani of another job opportunity, Nani leaves Lilo at home alone. Jumba and Pleakley chase Stitch back to the Pelekais' house, and the ensuing fight causes an explosion that destroys the house.

Nani gets the job, but frantically returns home after seeing a [[fire engine]] driving toward her house. Bubbles arrives to retrieve Lilo. While Bubbles and Nani argue about Lilo's well-being, Lilo runs away into the woods and encounters Stitch, who reveals his alien identity, just moments before Gantu captures them both. Stitch manages to escape just as Gantu's ship takes off. Nani confronts Stitch, but Jumba and Pleakley immediately capture him. Nani asks them to save Lilo, but they insist they only have legal authority to capture Stitch. As Nani breaks down, Stitch remembers ''{{okina}}[[ohana]]'', a term for "family" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue her. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani board Jumba's spaceship, pursue Gantu, and rescue Lilo.

The Grand Councilwoman arrives to retrieve Stitch herself, and fires Gantu for endangering Lilo and failing to capture Stitch. After observing Stitch's civilized behavior and being informed that Lilo legally owns Stitch because she bought him at the animal shelter, the Grand Councilwoman decrees that Stitch will live out his exile on Earth and that the Pelekai family is under the protection of the United Galactic Federation. Bubbles reveals he is a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who had previously met the Grand Councilwoman in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in 1973. Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley, having joined Lilo and Nani's family, rebuild their house with David and Bubbles' help.
