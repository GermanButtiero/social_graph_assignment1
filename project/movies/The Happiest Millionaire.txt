==Plot==
In autumn of 1916, Irish immigrant John Lawless ([[Tommy Steele]]) has applied for a butler position with eccentric Philadelphia millionaire [[Anthony J. Drexel Biddle]] (Fred MacMurray). Even though the family is a bit strange, Lawless soon learns that he fits right in. Mr. Biddle takes a liking to him immediately.

Mr. Biddle busies himself with his Biddle Boxing and Bible School (located in his [[stable]]) and with his [[alligator]]s in the [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]]. He is also anxious to get America into the [[World War I|war in Europe]], despite the government's policy of neutrality. His wife, Cordelia ([[Greer Garson]]), stands quietly by, accepting his eccentricities with a sense of pride and class. Their two sons, [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr.|Tony]] and Livingston ([[Paul Petersen]] and [[Eddie Hodges]]) are headed off to boarding school, not to be seen again. Their daughter, Cordy ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]), is a [[tomboy]] with a mean right hook who was educated by private tutors and has had limited contact with conventional society. She is frustrated by her apparent inability to attract suitors and wants to see what is beyond the Biddle manor.

Mr. Biddle reluctantly lets Cordy go to a boarding school as well after some prodding from both Cordy and from his Aunt Mary ([[Gladys Cooper]]). Cordy's roommate teaches her how to lure men with feminine wiles, and at a social dance hosted by her aunt and uncle, Cordy meets [[Angier Buchanan Duke]] ([[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]]) and they fall in love. He tells Cordy that he is fascinated with the invention of the [[automobile]] and wants to head to [[Detroit]], Michigan, to make his fortune there, instead of taking over his family's tobacco business.

That winter, Cordy comes back to her parents' home and tells them that she is engaged. At first, this is a difficult thing for Mr. Biddle to take. He does not want to give up his little girl, but after meeting Angier and witnessing first-hand his [[Jujutsu|Jiu Jitsu]] fighting skills, Mr. Biddle takes a liking to him and accepts the engagement. Then Cordy travels with Angier to New York City to meet his mother ([[Geraldine Page]]). Soon the Biddles and the Dukes are making arrangements for a very grand wedding.

It is by now the spring of 1917, and constant condescending comments from Angier's mother anger Cordy. To make matters worse, their families' elaborate planning for the "social event of the season", makes both Cordy and Angier feel pushed aside. The tension reaches a climax when Cordy learns that Angier has abandoned his plans for Detroit, and is instead taking his place in the family business, following his mother's wishes. Cordy angrily calls the wedding off, thinking of Angier as a mama's boy, and Angier storms out of the house. Both families are instantly in a tremendous state of upheaval. Mr. Biddle sends John Lawless to look after Angier.

John finds Angier at the local tavern, contemplating what he will do next, and tries to convince Angier to go back to Cordy. However, Angier is stubborn and thinks of other ways to deal with his problems, among other things saying that he wants to join the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. Angier unwittingly starts a bar fight (with a little help from John) and is hauled off to jail.

The next morning, Mr. Biddle comes to bail Angier out. He tells Angier he has to forget about his own dreams and accept his place in the family business. His words have the desired effect, inspiring Angier to defy his mother and elope with Cordy and go to Detroit. Cordy, however, believes her father talked Angier into it, so to prove his sincerity, amid the cheering of the cellmates, Angier throws Cordy over his shoulder and carries her out of the jail house to start their new life together.

===Longer version===
After Mr. and Mrs. Biddle return home a delegation of Marines arrive to inform him he has been made a "provisional captain" in the Marine Corps and is wanted immediately to go to [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]] to continue training the recruits, now that America is finally entering the War. Mr. Biddle accepts with delight, and the hearty congratulations of his suddenly appearing Bible Boxing Class.

A car with two people (presumably Cordie and Angie) drives toward a city skyline (presumably Detroit) dominated by factories with smoke clouding the sky at sunset.
