PLOT: Woody and Buzz Lightyear have become co-leaders of Andy's toys. Andy plans to take Woody to Cowboy Camp, but accidentally rips his arm. Andy's mother places Woody on a shelf, and Woody begins to fear that Andy will throw him away. The following day, Woody finds Wheezy, a penguin toy with a broken squeaker, who has also been shelved. After saving Wheezy from being sold at a yard sale, Woody is found and stolen by a greedy toy collector. Buzz fails to foil the theft, but finds clues identifying the collector as Al McWhiggin, the owner of the Al's Toy Barn store. Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex, and Hamm set out to rescue Woody.

At Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he was designed after the protagonist of ''Woody's Roundup'', a popular 1950s children's Western series, and meets his co-star character dolls: Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the Horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. While delighted to meet them, Woody realizes that Al plans to sell the entire ''Woody's Roundup'' collection to a toy museum in Tokyo. Woody announces that he has to return home to Andy, dismaying the gang, because the museum will not accept the collection without him, and they will go back into storage. After Woody's arm is repaired the next day, Woody learns that Jessie was abandoned by her owner, Emily, when she grew up. Convinced that Andy might do the same to him, Woody decides to go to the museum.

Meanwhile, Buzz's group reaches Al's Toy Barn and searches for Woody. Buzz encounters a Utility Belt Buzz toy; assuming he is a real space ranger going AWOL, Utility Belt Buzz imprisons Andy's Buzz. Utility Belt Buzz later meets Andy's other toys and, assuming they are on a mission to defeat his arch-nemesis, Emperor Zurg, accompanies them to Al's apartment. Andy's Buzz escapes and follows the gang, inadvertently releasing a toy Zurg who follows Buzz to destroy him.

Both Buzzes and the rest of the search party arrive at the apartment, but Woody initially refuses to go home with them. Shortly after the search party leaves, Woody reconsiders and invites the ''Woody's Roundup'' toys to join him and become Andy's toys. While a hesitant Jessie and an enthusiastic Bullseye accept Woody's offer, Pete refuses and blocks the others from leaving; having never been played with, he is adamant about going to the museum.

Al returns to the apartment and takes the ''Woody's Roundup'' collection to the airport. On the elevator ride down, Zurg appears and fights Utility Belt Buzz until he is knocked off the elevator by Rex. The two end up reconciling after Buzz learns Zurg is his father, while Andy's Buzz and the other toys pursue Al to the airport in a Pizza Planet truck while being accompanied by three toy aliens. Following  a prolonged pursuit through the airport's baggage sorting system—during which Pete re-opens the tear in Woody's arm—the other toys subdue Pete and place him in the backpack of a little girl, who takes Pete with her. They save Bullseye, but Jessie is loaded onto the plane. Woody, Buzz, and Bullseye work together to save her just as the plane takes off. The toys then return home to Andy's house.

Andy returns from Cowboy Camp that night, plays with Jessie and Bullseye, and repairs Woody and Wheezy the following morning. Al mourns the loss of the lucrative deal with the toy museum on television. Woody tells Buzz that he no longer fears Andy losing interest in him.
