==Plot==
547 days into their trip, in an unspecified future year, the spacecraft USS ''Palomino'' has nearly completed its mission exploring deep space. The crew consists of Captain Dan Holland, First Officer Lieutenant Charlie Pizer, journalist Harry Booth, [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]-sensitive scientist Dr. Kate McCrae, the expedition's civilian leader Dr. Alex Durant and the diminutive [[robot]] V.I.N.CENT. ("Vital Information Necessary CENTralized").

As it is returning to Earth, the ''Palomino'' discovers a [[black hole]] with the long-lost and apparently abandoned USS ''Cygnus'' nearby, the same ship that McCrae's father was aboard when it vanished 20 years prior. The ''Palomino'' decides to investigate and finds that there is a mysterious null gravity field surrounding the ''Cygnus'' that allows it to defy the massive gravitational pull of the black hole. The ''Palomino'' briefly strays outside the field and is damaged by the intense gravity, forcing it to emergency [[Spacecraft docking|dock]] with the ''Cygnus'', which no longer appears abandoned.

The cautious ''Palomino'' crew soon encounter Dr. Hans Reinhardt (one of Earth's most brilliant scientists, according to Durant). Reinhardt explains he has been alone on the ''Cygnus'' since it encountered a meteor field and was disabled. He ordered the human crew to return to Earth without him, but McCrae's father chose to remain aboard and has since died. To replace the crew, Reinhardt built faceless, black-robed drones, sentry robots and his sinister bodyguard robot, Maximilian. Reinhardt says he intends to fly the ''Cygnus'' through the black hole because 20 years of study has shown that it is possible. Only an enamoured Durant believes him and asks if he can accompany Reinhardt.

However, the rest of the ''Palomino'' crew start to become suspicious of Reinhardt. Booth sees a drone limping, while Holland witnesses an android funeral and discovers personal items in the ''Cygnus'' crew quarters. V.I.N.CENT. meets a battered earlier model of his type named BO.B. ("BiO-sanitation Battalion"). BO.B explains the drones are actually what is left of the human crew, who [[Mutiny|mutinied]] when Reinhardt refused to return to Earth after the ''Cygnus'' was damaged. McCrae's father was killed leading the mutiny, and the crew was [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]] and "reprogrammed" to serve Reinhardt. V.I.N.CENT. uses [[telepathy]] to tell McCrae. After she informs Durant what really happened, he removes a drone's faceplate, revealing the zombie-like face of a crew member. Durant tries to flee with McCrae, but is killed by Maximilian.

Reinhardt orders his robots to lobotomize McCrae, but just as the process begins, she is rescued by Holland, V.I.N.CENT. and BO.B. Harry Booth tries to escape alone in the ''Palomino'', but is shot down and fatally crashes into the ''Cygnus''. A subsequent [[Meteor shower|meteor storm]] and the explosion of the ship's overstressed main power plant cause the anti-gravity generator to fail. Without its null-gravity bubble, the ''Cygnus'' quickly starts to break apart under the black hole's huge gravitational forces.

Reinhardt and the ''Palomino'' survivors separately plan their escape in the [[Space probe|probe ship]] used to study the black hole. Reinhardt orders Maximilian to prepare the ship for launch, but then a large viewscreen falls on Reinhardt, pinning him to the deck. His cries for help are not acknowledged by the lobotimized crew nor Maximilian, who enters the elevator as his master calls for him and pursues the ''Palomino'' crew as they attempt to escape.

The crew nears the probe ship before being confronted again by Maximilian. He fatally damages BO.B. before battling with V.I.N.CENT. as McCrae, Holland and Pizer continue to the probe. V.I.N.CENT. defeats his opponent by drilling into Maximilian's armor, disabling his system and sending him hurtling into the black hole. Holland, Pizer, McCrae and V.I.N.CENT. launch the probe, which they soon realize has a pre-programmed flight path, taking them directly into the black hole.

Within the black hole, the ''Cygnus'' completely breaks apart. The drifting Reinhardt and Maximilian merge above a burning, [[hell]]ish landscape populated by dark-robed specters resembling ''Cygnus'' drones.<ref>{{cite news |last=Moss |first=Joshua |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/movies/black_hole_retrospective_000602.html |title=Does The Black Hole still suck? |work=[[Space.com]] |date=June 2, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040210230511/http://space.com/sciencefiction/movies/black_hole_retrospective_000602.html |archive-date=February 10, 2004}}</ref> Meanwhile, the probe ship is led through a cathedral-like [[Heaven|arched crystal tunnel]] by a floating, angelic figure. After the ship emerges from a [[white hole]], Holland, Pizer, McCrae and V.I.N.CENT. fly towards a planet near a bright star.
