PLOT: In a world inhabited by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfils her childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit police officer in the city of Zootopia. On her first day at the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), she is given parking duty by Chief Bogo and is hustled by red fox con artist Nick Wilde and his partner Finnick during her shift. The next day, Judy abandons her post to arrest small-time crook Duke Weaselton for stealing a bag of crocus bulbs. While Bogo is reprimanding Judy, Mrs. Otterton visits his office, pleading for someone to find her husband, Emmitt, one of several predators who have gone missing. Without seeking prior approval, Judy volunteers, and Bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination. When the city's assistant mayor, ewe Dawn Bellwether, praises Judy for taking the assignment, he agrees but demands Judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours.

Having ascertained that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into helping her by recording his confession to tax evasion. Tracking a limousine that picked up Emmitt, they learn the vehicle is owned by Mr. Big, an arctic shrew crime boss whom Nick has a history with. Mr. Big explains that Emmitt unexpectedly "went savage" and mindlessly attacked the limousine's chauffeur Renato Manchas, a black jaguar. Judy and Nick question Manchas, who explains that Emmitt yelled about "Night Howlers" before attacking him. Manchas also suddenly turns savage and pursues them. Judy traps Manchas and alerts the ZPD, but Manchas vanishes before backup arrives. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick reminds him that Judy still has 10 hours left to solve the case. He later reveals to her that as a child, he was bullied by his peers due to their prejudiced beliefs about foxes.

At City Hall, Bellwether allows them access to Zootopia's traffic cameras, which reveal Manchas was abducted by timberwolves, whom Judy assumes are the Night Howlers. Following the wolves, Judy and Nick locates Emmitt and the other missing predators, who are all "savage" and imprisoned in an asylum. Zootopia's mayor, Leodore Lionheart, had ordered the quarantine and is trying to determine what caused their feral behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.

Judy, praised for solving the case, invites Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At a press conference, she accidentally implies that the predators' physiology caused the savageness epidemic. Disappointed and offended, Nick abandons Judy, whose comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt, she quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow.

Later, while managing her parents’ vegetable stand, Judy learns that Night Howlers are actually ''Midnicampum'' flowers, which have severe, lasting psychotropic effects if ingested. Realizing that someone is using the flowers to turn predators savage, she returns to Zootopia and tearfully reconciles with Nick. Aided by Mr. Big, they interrogate Weaselton, who admits that a ram named Doug hired him to steal the Night Howler bulbs. They find Doug in his laboratory hidden in the subway, where he manufactures a serum from the Night Howlers to use against predators via a tranquilizer dart. Judy and Nick obtain a serum pistol as evidence after a pursuit in the subway, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and reveals herself to have masterminded a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Bellwether traps Judy and Nick in an exhibit, shoots Nick with the serum pistol in an attempt to have Judy killed and orders the ZPD to capture him, but Judy and Nick reveal that they had replaced the darts with blueberries and recorded Bellwether's confession.

Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested, while the still-incarcerated Lionheart publicly disregards her scheme, insisting that imprisoning the infected predators was "doing the wrong thing for the right reason". The predators are cured and rehabilitated, and Judy is reinstated into the ZPD. Nine months later, Nick graduates from the police academy, becoming Judy's partner and the first fox police officer.
