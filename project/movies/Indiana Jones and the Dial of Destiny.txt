== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words.  -->	
Towards the end of [[World War II]], [[Nazis]] capture [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[archaeologist]] Basil Shaw as they attempt to retrieve the [[Spear of Longinus|Lance of Longinus]] from a castle in the [[French Alps]]<!--as mentioned by Helena-->. [[Astrophysicist]] Jürgen Voller informs his superiors the Lance is fake, but he has found half of Archimedes' Dial, an [[Antikythera mechanism]] built by the ancient [[Syracusan]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] which reveals time fissures, thereby allowing for possible [[time travel]]. Jones escapes onto a [[Berlin]]-bound train filled with [[Nazi plunder|looted antiquities]] and frees Basil. He obtains the Dial piece, and they escape just before [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] derail the train. 

In 1969, Jones, who is retiring from [[Hunter College]] in [[NYC]], has been separated from his wife [[Marion Ravenwood]] since their son [[Mutt Williams|Mutt]]'s death in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Jones' goddaughter, archaeologist Helena Shaw, unexpectedly visits and wants to research the Dial. Jones warns that her late father Basil became obsessed with studying it before relinquishing it to Jones to destroy, which he never did.

As Jones and Helena retrieve the Dial half from the college archives, Voller's accomplices attack them. The [[CIA]] assists Voller, now working for [[NASA]] as "Dr. Schmidt". Helena, revealed as an antiquities smuggler, absconds with the Dial to auction it on the [[black market]]. Jones is framed for two colleagues' murders, forcing him to escape through the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing [[ticker-tape parade|parade]], then an [[List of protests against the Vietnam War|anti-war protest]].

Jones seeks out his old friend [[Sallah]], now a New York cab driver, who helps him flee the country after surmising that Helena will likely sell the Dial in [[Tangier]]. There, Jones disrupts Helena's illegal private auction, but Voller and his henchmen arrive and steal the artifact. Jones, Helena, and her teenage accomplice Teddy Kumar chase them through the streets in a [[tuk-tuk]]. The CIA intercepts Voller after the U.S. government disavows him for going rogue, but he and his cohorts murder the agents and steal the CIA helicopter. 

Jones, Helena and Teddy trail Voller to [[Greece]] and team up with Jones' old friend Renaldo, a professional diver. Guided by Basil's research, they dive to the [[Antikythera wreck]] and retrieve a "graphikos" tablet containing directions to the Dial's other half. Voller arrives and murders Renaldo and his crew, but Jones' group escapes and heads to [[Sicily]], pursued by Voller. 

Inside the [[Ear of Dionysius]] cavern, Jones and Helena find Archimedes' tomb, the Dial's second half, and a 20th-century wristwatch on Archimedes' skeletal arm. Voller appears and captures Jones, wounding him. Helena and Teddy escape and chase Voller. Voller reassembles the dial, intending to time-travel back to 1939 to help lead [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] to [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|victory]] in [[World War II]] by assassinating [[Adolf Hitler]] and avoiding his mistakes. At an airfield, Voller activates the Dial and locates a time fissure in the sky. Jones is held captive on Voller's stolen plane while Helena [[wheel-well stowaway|stows away through its landing gear]]. Teddy follows in another plane. 

While approaching the fissure, Jones realizes that [[continental drift]] could have altered the timeline coordinates. Rather than 1939, the group arrives at the [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] in 214 BC. The warring armies shoot down Voller's plane, believing it to be a [[dragon]]. Jones and Helena parachute out just before it crashes, killing all aboard, while Teddy lands safely. Archimedes finds Voller's body and wristwatch in the wreckage. He gives Jones the Dial but keeps the watch. Jones and Helena learn that Archimedes created the Dial to bring allies from the future through fissures that lead only to 214 BC to save Syracuse and lift the siege. As the fissure begins to collapse, Jones wants to remain behind, feeling he has nothing left to return to. Helena, fearing a [[Temporal paradox|time paradox]] and unwilling to give up on him, knocks Jones unconscious. Back in 1969, a recovering Jones awakens in his apartment and reunites with Helena, Teddy, Sallah and Marion, whom he reconciles with.
