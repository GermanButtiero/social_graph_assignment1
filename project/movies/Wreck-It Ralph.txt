PLOT: When Litwak's Arcade closes for the day, the video game characters leave their in-game roles and socialize via a power strip called Game Central Station. Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of the platform game ''Fix-It Felix, Jr.'', is frustrated with his assigned role. After being ostracized at his game's 30th-anniversary party, Ralph decides to win a medal, convinced that it will earn him respect. Upon learning that the first-person shooter ''Hero's Duty'' awards medals, Ralph sneaks into ''Hero's Duty'' and obtains a medal after getting past insectoid monsters known as Cy-Bugs.

Ralph accidentally launches himself in an escape shuttle with a Cy-Bug inside and crash-lands in ''Sugar Rush'', a confectionery-themed kart racing game. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled "out of order", putting it at risk of being unplugged. Fix-It Felix, Jr. himself leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of ''Hero's Duty''. Calhoun tracks the Cy-Bug, as Cy-Bugs behave as a virus once outside their game. Felix worries Ralph will meet the same fate as Turbo, the protagonist of the racing game ''TurboTime'', who grew envious of a new ''RoadBlasters'' cabinet's success and invaded it, resulting in both games being unplugged.

In ''Sugar Rush'', racer Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters will be playable the next day. King Candy, the ruler of ''Sugar Rush'' world, forbids her to race, as she is a glitch. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win; he helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside Diet Cola Mountain. Meanwhile, Calhoun and Felix arrive in ''Sugar Rush'', where they fall into "Nesquik-sand", work together to escape, and begin to fall in love.

King Candy hacks into ''Sugar Rush'' code and retrieves the medal, giving it back to Ralph. He claims that if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching will lead to ''Sugar Rush'' being labeled out of order and unplugged, and Vanellope, unable to leave the game due to being a glitch, will die. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race and destroys her kart. Meanwhile, Calhoun abandons Felix when he unintentionally reminds her of her late fiancé, who was eaten by a Cy-Bug on their wedding day. Felix is imprisoned by King Candy's assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun discovers that the Cy-Bug has multiplied exponentially.

Upon returning to ''Fix-It Felix, Jr.'', which has been evacuated, Ralph notices a picture of Vanellope on the ''Sugar Rush'' cabinet. He returns to ''Sugar Rush'' and interrogates Sour Bill for answers, who reveals that King Candy stole Vanellope's code. King Candy's edits to the code also have ensured no one but himself knows Vanellope's true role. However, if Vanellope completes a race, the game will reset itself, deleting all of King Candy's changes. Ralph frees Vanellope and Felix from the dungeon. Felix fixes Vanellope's kart. Vanellope belatedly enters the race, but the Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game. Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters.

Unaware of the Cy-Bugs, King Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing them both to glitch. The glitching unmasks King Candy as Turbo, who secretly took over ''Sugar Rush'' after surviving the unplugging of ''TurboTime''. Vanellope flees as Turbo is devoured by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster. Remembering from ''Hero's Duty'' that a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo and collapses the Mentos roof of Diet Cola Mountain, creating a glowing eruption that lures and destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line. The game resets, revealing her as the true ruler of ''Sugar Rush'', though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage.

Ralph returns to his game, content with his role as a bad guy and finally respected by his fellow characters. Felix and Calhoun marry, and Ralph watches Vanellope become ''Sugar Rush'' favorite character.
