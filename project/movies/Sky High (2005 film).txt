<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->
Will Stronghold lives with his superhero parents, Steve Stronghold / The Commander and Josie DeMarco-Stronghold / Jetstream, in Maxville. Will is anxious about attending his parents' alma mater, Sky High, a school located on a secret floating campus, because he secretly has not developed any superpowers yet.

On their first day, Will, his best friend Layla Williams, and the other freshmen are harassed by seniors Speed, Lash, and Penny Lent. Will meets and falls for Gwen Grayson, a popular senior and technopath. Additionally, Will is assigned to the "Hero Support" curriculum and becomes a sidekick due to his lack of powers, prompting Layla to join him in protest of the school's two-track education system.

Unaware of what happened to his son, Steve shows Will his hidden trophy room, the Secret Sanctum. He expresses particular fondness for the "Pacifier", a weapon he took from his presumed dead arch-nemesis Royal Pain 16 years earlier, failing to notice a hidden camera in a new trophy.

While befriending his fellow sidekicks, Will comes into conflict with [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] student Warren Peace, whose supervillain father was imprisoned by Steve. In the ensuing fight, Will develops his father's super-strength. Upon being transferred to the Hero curriculum, Will spends more time with Gwen and her friends, ignoring Layla and the sidekicks. Layla later confides to Warren that she is in love with Will while Gwen invites his parents as honored guests to the Homecoming dance and they spend the evening together.

On the day before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house and has Speed steal the Pacifier. Layla tries to investigate the party, but is stopped by Gwen, who claims Will knows about her feelings for him and is too polite to reject her. As Layla leaves in tears, Will breaks up with Gwen and refuses to attend the dance. Layla ignores Will's attempts to reconcile while Warren reveals her obvious feelings for him to Will. Will goes through his father's yearbook and sees a student resembling Gwen named Sue Tenny, who disappeared before his parents' graduation. Realizing that the Pacifier is missing, Will assumes Tenny became Royal Pain and Gwen is her daughter, and heads to Sky High to stop her with help from a powerless bus driver named Ron Wilson.

At the dance, Gwen reveals herself as Royal Pain. With Speed, Lash, and Penny's aid, Gwen uses the Pacifier to turn the students, staff, and Will's parents into babies, intending to kidnap and raise them to become supervillains. After reconciling with Layla, Will teams up with her, Warren, Ron, and the other sidekicks to rescue the captives and defeat Gwen's allies. In the ensuing fight, Gwen reveals she was Tenny and that she had been de-aged by the Pacifier during her last fight with Steve while Will develops Josie's flight power and defeats her. Gwen sabotages the school's anti-gravity drive, but the sidekicks successfully restart it, and Will uses both of his powers to lift the school back in place.

With Sky High saved, Gwen and her allies are imprisoned while her captives are restored to their proper ages, and the Pacifier is destroyed. Ron falls into a vat of toxic waste and becomes a superhero. Will befriends Warren and enters a relationship with Layla.
