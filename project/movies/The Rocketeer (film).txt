==Plot==
In 1938 [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], gangsters from Eddie Valentine's gang steal a prototype [[Jet pack|rocket pack]] from aviation magnate [[Howard Hughes]]. During their escape from the pursuing police, the getaway driver quickly stops and hides the rocket in a [[Curtiss JN Jenny]] [[biplane]] cockpit at an airfield. As the chase continues, [[stunt pilot]] [[Cliff Secord]]'s yellow and black [[Granville Gee Bee Model Z Super Sportster|Gee Bee Z]] [[monoplane]] is destroyed, ending his air-racing career. Film star Neville Sinclair hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket, and sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to find its location. Meanwhile, Cliff and his [[Aircraft maintenance technician|airplane mechanic]], Peevy, find the rocket and begin testing it.

Cliff's girlfriend is aspiring actress Jenny Blake, who has a small part in Sinclair's latest film; recent events start driving a wedge in their relationship. Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local [[air show]], Cliff uses the rocket to rescue his elderly friend Malcolm, who is piloting the biplane to save Cliff's job. This makes Cliff an immediate flying sensation, but also sets Sinclair and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] on his trail.

Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket. The FBI arrives soon after, but Cliff and Peevy escape while Lothar steals the latter's [[schematic]]. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn about Jenny's date with Sinclair and the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, but a stray fired bullet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with chewing gum. Cliff flies to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new Rocketeer alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and in the ensuing melée, Sinclair kidnaps Jenny.

At Sinclair's home, he attempts to seduce Jenny, but she knocks him out and discovers he is a spy for [[Nazi Germany]]. She is quickly recaptured and forced to tell Cliff to bring the rocket to the [[Griffith Observatory]] in exchange for her life. Shortly thereafter, Cliff is arrested by the FBI and taken to Howard Hughes, who explains that his rocket is based on a prototype [[Nazism|Nazi]] scientists have been unsuccessful in developing, and shows him a Nazi [[propaganda film]] depicting an army of flying commandos using the perfected rocket packs to invade the [[United States]]. He also mentions that the FBI are trying to locate a Nazi spy in Hollywood employing Valentine's gang, whom Cliff realizes is Sinclair. When Hughes and the FBI demand the return of the rocket, Cliff escapes, but inadvertently leaves behind a clue to where he is headed.

Cliff flies to the rendezvous, where Sinclair demands that Cliff hand over the rocket. Cliff divulges to Eddie that the actor is a Nazi spy; the infuriated Valentine gang, while being gangsters are still patriots, turns their weapons on Sinclair. However, Sinclair summons a hidden troop of heavily armed Nazi [[Sturmabteilung|S.A.]], as the German [[rigid airship|airship]] ''Luxembourg'' appears overhead to evacuate Sinclair and the troops. The FBI, who have secretly followed Cliff, suddenly announce their presence, and they and the mobsters join forces and battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny aboard the airship.

Cliff flies to and boards ''Luxembourg'', but during the ensuing showdown, Jenny accidentally starts a fire with a flare gun on the airship's bridge. Sinclair holds Jenny hostage, forcing Cliff to give him the rocket, but not before Cliff covertly removes the chewing gum patching the fuel leak. Sinclair dons the rocket and flies off, but the leaking fuel causes the rocket to catch on fire, causing him to fall to his death. Lothar is killed as ''Luxembourg'' explodes, but Cliff and Jenny are rescued just in time by Howard Hughes and Peevy flying a [[Pitcairn PCA-2]] [[autogyro]].

Hughes later presents Cliff with a brand-new Gee Bee Z air racer and a pack of [[Beemans gum]]. As Hughes leaves, Jenny returns Peevy's stolen rocket blueprint to him, which she found in Sinclair's home; Peevy decides that, with some modifications, he can build an even better one.
