==Plot==
Darby O'Gill and his daughter, Katie, live in Rathcullen, a small [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] town, where Darby is the caretaker for Lord Fitzpatrick's estate. Darby continually tries to catch a tribe of [[leprechaun]]s, particularly their king, Brian Connors.

Lord Fitzpatrick retires Darby, replacing him with a young [[Dublin]]er named Michael McBride. Darby begs Michael not to tell Katie he has been replaced, and he reluctantly agrees. While chasing a ''[[púca]]'' disguised as Fitzpatrick's horse Cleopatra, Darby is captured by the leprechauns and taken to their mountain lair, Knocknasheega. Brian has brought Darby there to live with him, as he has come to respect and care for Darby, even as an adversary. He must also prevent Katie from learning that he lost his job and that Darby cannot leave Knocknasheega.

Darby tricks the leprechauns into opening the mountain and leaving by playing "The Fox Chase" on Brian's [[Stradivarius]] violin. Darby escapes, and expecting Brian to pursue him, later engages him in a drinking game with a jug of ''[[poitín]]'', allowing him to capture the leprechaun at sunrise when his magic has no effect. Since Darby has caught him, Brian grants him three wishes. Brian tries to trick Darby into making additional wishes, but Darby recalls that wishing for a fourth forfeits them all from their previous encounter. Darby's first wish is for Brian to stay by his side for two weeks or until Darby runs out of wishes. Darby tries to show Michael the King while he is trapped in a sack, but Michael sees only a rabbit; Darby accidentally wishes that Michael could see Brian, which the fairy king grants with the caveat, "He does see me, he sees me as a rabbit."

Pony Sugrue, the town bully, decides to try to take Michael's new job and Katie for himself. Pony's mother, Sheelah, tells Katie about Darby's retirement, causing Katie to confront Darby and Michael angrily. When Cleopatra got loose again, Katie chased her to Knocknasheega. Darby later finds Katie fallen at the bottom of a cliff and stricken with a deadly fever. A [[banshee]] appears and summons the [[Dullahan]] on a [[death coach]] to transport Katie's soul. Brian sadly grants Darby's third wish to take Katie's place. Inside the death coach, Brian consoles Darby, then, to save him, tricks him into wishing he would have Brian's company in the afterlife. This counts as a fourth wish, and Brian voids all his others. Darby is freed from the death coach and returns to Katie, who makes a full recovery. Michael later confronts and humiliates Pony at the pub. Michael and Katie fall in love with Darby's approval.
