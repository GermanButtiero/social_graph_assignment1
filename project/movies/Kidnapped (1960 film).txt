==Plot==
In 18th-century Scotland, young David Balfour ([[James MacArthur]]) takes a letter of introduction from his recently deceased father to the House of Shaws, where he is greeted without much enthusiasm by his miserly uncle Ebenezer ([[John Laurie]]). David finds that Ebenezer is disliked by his neighbours and begins to ask questions about family affairs. Ebenezer tries to arrange a fatal accident for David. David accompanies Ebenezer to a meeting with a seafaring associate, Captain Hoseason ([[Bernard Lee]]). Hoseason lures David aboard his ship and [[Shanghaiing|shanghais]] him, at Ebenezer's instigation.

At sea, David learns he is to be sold into [[Indenture|indentured servitude]]. A fog comes up and the ship collides with a boat. Alan Breck Stewart ([[Peter Finch]]), the only survivor of the boat, is brought aboard and pays for his passage, but the captain plots to kill him for the rest of his money. David warns Alan, and they overcome the crew. Alan coerces Hoseason into putting them ashore. The ship founders, but David manages to reach land.

After several dangerous encounters, he is rescued by Alan, who turns out to be a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] wanted by the authorities. Evading the soldiers, the two make their way back to the House of Shaws, where Alan tricks Ebenezer into admitting his crimes within the hearing of a hidden witness, allowing David to claim his inheritance.
