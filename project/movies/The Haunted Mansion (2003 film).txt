==Plot==
Successful [[realtor]]s Jim and Sara Evers live in [[Louisiana]] with their young children, Megan and Michael, but Jim's workaholic ways begin to alienate him from his family. After missing his and Sara's [[wedding anniversary]] to pursue a lead, Jim tries to make amends by planning a vacation to the nearby lake. Sara is subsequently contacted by the residents of Gracey Manor about negotiating a sale. Eager to make the deal, Jim has the family stop at the mansion on their way to the lake, where they meet the owner, Edward Gracey, and his servants; [[butler]] Ramsley, [[maid]] Emma, and [[footman]] Ezra.
 
When a [[thunderstorm]] floods the nearby river, Gracey lets the family stay at the mansion for the night. Ramsley takes Jim to its [[library]] to discuss the deal with Gracey, but he becomes trapped in a secret passage. Gracey gives Sara a tour of the mansion, discussing his past and the death of his "grandfather" after the supposed suicide of his lover, Elizabeth Henshaw. The Evers children follow a [[Will-o'-the-wisp|spectral orb]] to the mansion's [[attic]] and find a [[painting]] of a woman resembling Sara. Emma and Ezra soon appear and identify the woman as the late Elizabeth.
 
Meanwhile, Jim meets Madame Leota, the ghost of a [[Romani people|gypsy]] whose head is encased in her [[crystal ball]]. He runs into Emma, Ezra, and his children and returns to Leota for answers about Elizabeth's likeness to Sara. It is revealed that the mansion's inhabitants are [[ghosts]], cursed a century ago by Elizabeth and Gracey's untimely deaths, that can only enter the afterlife when the couple is reunited; Sara is believed to be Elizabeth's [[reincarnation]], though Leota cautions that things are not as they seem. She sends the Evers to the mansion's [[cemetery]] to find a [[Lock and key|key]] that will reveal the truth about Elizabeth's death. In a crypt beneath a [[mausoleum]], Jim and Megan find the key, but inadvertently disturb its [[Zombie|undead]] occupants. The duo narrowly escape with help from Michael, who overcomes his [[arachnophobia]] when they are locked in.
 
Leota then leads them to a locked [[Trunk (luggage)|trunk]] in the attic, in which Jim finds a letter that Elizabeth wrote to Gracey, revealing her intent to marry him and indicating that she was murdered. Ramsley then appears and it is revealed that he murdered Elizabeth to prevent his master from abandoning his heritage, as he believed their relationship was unacceptable. To hide the truth, Ramsley detains the children in another trunk and literally throws Jim out of the mansion, subsequently enchanting it to keep him at bay. As Gracey and Sara rendezvous in the ballroom, she is confused when he asks if she recognizes him and insists she is Elizabeth. The room then fills with dancing ghosts as Gracey reveals his true colors, but Sara denies being Elizabeth and flees to her room. Gracey starts to have doubts, but Ramsley insists that Sara is Elizabeth and will eventually remember as he then blackmails her into marrying Gracey in exchange for her children's safety. At Leota's encouragement, Jim breaks in to the mansion, rescuing the children and stopping the wedding. He then gives Elizabeth's letter to Gracey, who furiously confronts Ramsley, who rages at his master's apparent selfishness for loving Elizabeth and summons wraiths to attack the group. However, with the truth revealed, a [[demon]] emerges from the ballroom's fireplace and drags Ramsley down to [[Hell]]. He attempts to take Jim with him, but Jim is saved by Gracey.

Sara collapses, having been poisoned by Ramsley during the wedding ceremony. The spectral orb appears and, possessing Sara, is revealed to be Elizabeth, who could only be freed from her spectral form once the truth was revealed. She and Gracey reunite as Sara is revived. With the curse lifted, Gracey gives the Evers the deed to the mansion and departs to [[Heaven]] with Elizabeth and the mansion's inhabitants. Afterwards, the Evers set off for their intended vacation, accompanied by Leota and a quartet of singing [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]]s that Jim and the children encountered in the cemetery.
