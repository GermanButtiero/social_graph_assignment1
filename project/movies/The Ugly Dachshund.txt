PLOT: Fran Garrison and her husband Mark are a young, happily married couple and the proud owners of an award-winning dachshund named Danke. The movie begins with them frantically getting into the car and heading to the hospital as Danke is expecting a litter of pups. In a hurry to the hospital, Officer Carmody tries to pull them over for going 50 mph in a 25 mph zone. After notifying him that they are on the way to the hospital and indicating that Fran is in labor, Officer Carmody pulls in front of them, turns on the sirens, and escorts them to the county hospital.

After he arrives and finds that Mr. and Mrs. Garrison have gone past him, he gets back on his motorcycle and follows them to the vet. It is then revealed that Danke is the one in labor. While Mark is outside waiting for Fran, Officer Carmody catches up to him. After Mark thanks him for helping them get to the vet on time, Officer Carmody reveals that he was under the impression that Mrs. Garrison was the one in labor and proceeds to write multiple traffic violation tickets, totalling $110. When Mr. Garrison arrives at the vet to pick up Danke and her three female puppies, (Wilhelmina, Heidi, and Chloe), veterinarian Dr. Pruitt mentions that his female Great Dane, Duchess, has also given birth, but pushed away one of her male puppies because she did not have enough milk for him. Doc Pruitt convinces Mark to bring the Great Dane puppy home because Danke had too much milk, and she could save his life. When he arrives home and Fran notices that there is another puppy, she is surprised but does not suspect that the puppy is from another litter and reminds Mark that he should thank Danke for giving him a boy like he always wanted. He eventually tells Fran the truth about the male puppy and names him Brutus. 

As Brutus grows up with Fran's dachshund puppies, he believes he is one of them and picks up mannerisms, such as hunching close to the ground to walk. The dachshunds are mischievous creatures and lead Brutus through a series of comic misadventures, such as the dachshunds tearing up Danke's sweater, Mark's studio being splattered with paint, Brutus breaking Fran's bed, Officer Carmody (now Sergeant Carmody) being chased up a tree after Brutus mistakes him for a burglar, and a garden party being turned topsy-turvy after the caterers mistake Brutus for a lion. These events and her refusal to believe her dachshunds are behind the mischief result in Fran wanting Mark to remove Brutus from the house, but when he saves her favorite puppy, Chloe, from a garbage truck, she changes her mind.

Mark and Fran later enter their dogs in a dog show with Brutus meeting others of his breed. He notices a female Harlequin Great Dane and stands at attention, soon going on to win two blue ribbons. Brutus finally finds out what it is like to be a Great Dane, making the dachshunds respect him while Mark and Fran decide to end competing in dog shows and embark on a much happier relationship.
