PLOT: Piglet has made a scrapbook containing pictures that depict all of the adventures he has gone on with his friends. One day, Piglet meets Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, and Eeyore, who exclude him from their plot to steal a swarm of bees' honey because of his small size, even after Piglet saves them from being attacked by the bees. Disheartened, Piglet sets out to discover how he can be useful. Meanwhile, after being getting attacked by the bees a second time, Piglet's friends discover his disappearance and decide to search for him; using Piglet's scrapbook as a guide, they use its pictures to tell the stories depicted therein, leading to several flashbacks.

The first story tells when Kanga and Roo first moved to the Hundred Acre Wood. Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and Rabbit are afraid of the newcomers and Rabbit concocts a plan to use Piglet as a decoy, so they can ransom Roo to force Kanga to leave. Kanga sees through the ruse and decides to play along by pretending that Piglet is Roo. Initially frightened and embarrassed by Kanga's strict behavior towards him, Piglet soon begins to realize her kindness, and he convinces his friends to accept Kanga and Roo into the Wood. Back in the present, Roo joins the others in searching for Piglet.

The second story tells how Christopher Robin led everyone in the Hundred Acre Wood on an expedition to find the North Pole. The adventure turns catastrophic when Roo falls into a river as the rest of the gang frantically attempt to save him. Piglet uses a long stick to launch Roo out of the river before giving the stick to Pooh to try to catch Roo, who is caught by Kanga. Piglet's heroism is overlooked when Christopher Robin sees Pooh holding the stick, believing it to be the North Pole, and credits Pooh for finding it. Back in the present, the friends begin to realize how much they have ignored Piglet's actions.

The third story tells the building of the House at Pooh Corner. Pooh, Piglet, and Tigger get the idea of building Eeyore a house in an area they name "Pooh Corner", using some neatly stacked sticks for building. After many failed attempts, Pooh decides to offer Eeyore to move in with him before Eeyore reveals that the sticks Pooh, Piglet and Tigger found was actually his house. Piglet manages to rebuild Eeyore's house and shows it to him, satisfying the donkey. 

Back in the present, an argument between Rabbit and Tigger ends with the scrapbook falling into a river. Without their guide and with a storm coming, the group sadly return to Piglet's house, where they draw pictures depicting all of Piglet's heroic actions; inspired by their drawings, they decide to resume their search for Piglet. During their search, they find Piglet's scrapbook suspended on a hollow log looming over a waterfall. Pooh goes to retrieve it, but he falls into a hole in the log, and the others are unable to reach him. At that moment, Piglet arrives and, with encouragement from his friends, helps pull Pooh to safety just as the log begins to break in half. Everyone manages to escape right when the front half of the log breaks off, but the scrapbook itself is destroyed by the fall. Although saddened by this loss, the group take Piglet back to his house to show him all of their drawings, much to Piglet's joy.

Sometime later, a party is thrown in honor of Piglet, where Pooh reveals that he renamed Eeyore's home "Pooh and Piglet Corner" in appreciation of all the big things that Piglet has ever done. During this scene, the camera pulls back to show a large shadow of Piglet behind everyone.
