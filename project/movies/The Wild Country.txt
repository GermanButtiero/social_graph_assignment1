PLOT: In the late 1880s, Jim and Kate Tanner along with their sons Virgil and Andrew move from Pittsburgh to a farm in Wyoming, where they find the ranch in dilapidated condition. To make matters worse, Jim learns from the trapper Thompson and his Shoshone companion Two Dog that the source of the water for his land runs through property owned by the powerful rancher Ab Cross, meaning Jim is at Ab's mercy. Ab is uncooperative and refuses to stop letting his steers graze on Tanner land. Jim's threat to take Ab to court is met with laughter and Jim is told that there are no laws in their territory.

Later, when Ab learns that Jim is trying to contact the marshal in distant Cheyenne, the two men get into a fight in which Jim is injured but Ab gets knocked out. Ab retaliates by ordering his men to close a dam, cutting off the Tanner family's water supply completely. Virgil tries to unplug the dam, and while rescuing his son from Ab's men Jim is shot in the leg. The Tanner ranch is devastated by a cyclone and Kate is determined to move the family back East, but she is persuaded by Jim and Virgil to stay.

Soon after, the marshal arrives with a court order that requires Ab to open the dam. That night, as the Tanners are celebrating, they realize that their barn is on fire. As they fight the flames, Ab on horseback shoots Jim, kicks away Kate and turns to shoot Jim again, but he himself is shot dead by Virgil. Ab's men are repentant and promise to rebuild the barn, and the Tanners are finally free to live as ranchers in peace.
