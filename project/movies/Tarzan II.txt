== Plot ==
As a young boy raised by gorillas after the death of his parents in the African jungle, Tarzan worries that the mythical monster known as the Zugor will one day try to capture him. He is frustrated that he cannot run as fast as the other young gorillas in his family, and his attempts to prove his worth constantly cause chaos, much to Kerchak's dismay. When an accident after the gorillas cross a canyon leaves his mother, Kala, believing Tarzan to be dead, the other gorillas feel that Tarzan has met a fitting end. Tarzan listens to their feedback and believes that it would be best for everyone's good to distance himself from the family.

Alone in the jungle, Tarzan is pursued by Sabor the leopard, ending up in a rocky place known as the Dark Mountain. When the monster's echo calls, Sabor runs away while Tarzan is captured by two hulking, spoiled gorilla brothers, Uto and Kago, and their overprotective mother, Gunda. But when the monster's echo is heard again in the valley, the three of them, just as scared as Tarzan, run away, giving Tarzan the chance to escape. Along the way, he meets a capricious old gorilla, who initially tries to keep the boy at bay. Tarzan, however, discovers that this old gorilla is actually Zugor, who uses hollow trees as loudspeakers to amplify his voice while pretending to be a monster, so as to scare the other jungle creatures away from his territory and food. Tarzan uses this discovery to force Zugor to let him stay with him. Due to Tarzan's cheerfulness and helpfulness, Zugor begins to like him. Tarzan continues to try to find out who he is along with Zugor, while both promise not to tell anyone about their identities.

Tarzan's two best friends, Terk and Tantor, search for him, while Kala also learns that he is alive and searches for him. Terk and Tantor get into trouble in the Dark Mountain when they are confronted by Mama Gunda, Uto, and Kago, but manage to escape them. The two then find Tarzan and they all leave the Dark Mountain together, with Mama Gunda and her sons following them. Tarzan does not want to return home with them and reveals to them that there is no monster, which Mama Gunda and her sons overhear, discovering who Zugor really is and now they are looking for him. Uto and Kago destroy his treehouse in revenge, and Zugor accuses Tarzan of breaking his promise to him and leaves, refusing to help him again. Kala arrives near the Dark Mountain and is confronted by Mama Gunda and her sons, with Tarzan realizing what he is: a Tarzan with his own tricks that no one else can do in the jungle, while Zugor returns and befriends him again.

Tarzan is able to use tricks and traps to defeat Uto and Kago, while Terk and Tantor try to save Kala when she begins to fall off a cliff. Tarzan eventually saves her while Zugor holds Mama Gunda hostage. Due to their chemistry and a comment Zugor made that she has "beautiful eyes", they fall in love. Uto and Kago return and are shocked to see them together. Tarzan tells Kala that she was right and that he is part of the family too, and along with Terk and Tantor they return to the pack.

Kala gives Tarzan a hug and tells him how proud she is of him for saving her, while Mama Gunda punishes Uto and Kago for destroying Zugor's treehouse, ordering them to rebuild it and not fight or destroy things again. Tarzan, Terk, and Tantor play a game with a monster, where Tarzan is now happy and proud of himself for who he is.
