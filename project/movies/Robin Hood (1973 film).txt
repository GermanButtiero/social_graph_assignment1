PLOT: In Medieval England, minstrel Alan-a-Dale narrates the story about an heroic outlaw named Robin Hood. While crossing Sherwood Forest, Robin and his friend Little John narrowly escape capture by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his archers. They learn that the arrogant, greedy, and immature Prince John — who has usurped the throne from his brother King Richard after his aide-de-camp Sir Hiss hypnotized Richard into fighting in the Crusades — will be traveling through the forest. Disguised as fortunetellers, they rob the Royal caravan, embarrassing Prince John, who promises revenge. 

Robin and Little John distribute Prince John's wealth among the starving and overtaxed villagers of Nottingham. Robin also gives a hat and bow to young Skippy Rabbit for the latter's birthday. Trying out the bow, Skippy accidentally fires an arrow into the courtyard of Prince John's castle. While retrieving it, Skippy and his friends meet King Richard’s niece Maid Marian and her lady-in-waiting Lady Kluck. Skippy's hat reminds Maid Marian of Robin Hood, and she reveals that they were childhood sweethearts. She wonders if Robin Hood still remembers her.

Meanwhile, Robin is thinking of Maid Marian at his and Little John's forest hideaway. Local priest Friar Tuck brings news that Prince John will be hosting an archery tournament; the grand prize will be a kiss from Maid Marian. Ignoring that it is a trap set by Prince John, Robin and Little John, disguised respectively as a Devonshire stork and the Duke of Chutney, infiltrate the competition, which Robin wins; however, Prince John sees through Robin's disguise and sentences him to death. Maid Marian pleads for Robin's life; while they proclaim their love for each other, Little John gets Robin released by threatening Prince John with a dagger in his back. Suddenly, the Sheriff of Nottingham intervenes, and Prince John again orders Robin's death. Robin, Little John, Maid Marian, and Lady Kluck fight Prince John's soldiers. During the fight, Robin proposes to Maid Marian, which she accepts. Robin, Maid Marian, Lady Kluck, and Little John escape.

Robin and Maid Marian share a romantic evening, which is disrupted by the partying of the Nottingham villagers. They sing a song, "The Phony King of England," that mocks Prince John's fraud and incompetence; the song becomes popular even among Prince John's own advisors. Prince John angrily triples the taxes on the villagers, all of whom are soon jailed when their money runs out. Visiting Friar Tuck's now-empty church, the Sheriff of Nottingham takes the last farthing from the poor box. When Friar Tuck finally snaps and begins assaulting the Sheriff in his rage, he is arrested for high treason. Prince John orders his execution as bait to trap Robin Hood.

The night before the execution, Robin and Little John break into the jail. They free the villagers, who make off with Prince John's wealth. Sir Hiss tries to stop the breakout by rousing the castle. The villagers escape, but Robin is trapped while rescuing Skippy's younger sister Tagalong. The Sheriff of Nottingham chases Robin with a lit torch, setting the castle on fire. Cornered, Robin evades Prince John's archers by diving from a turret into the moat. Sir Hiss, fed up with Prince John’s constant abuse and failures, criticizes him for the plot, which resulted in his mother's castle being destroyed. Infuriated, Prince John chases Sir Hiss through the flames.

Some time later, King Richard returns from the Crusades. He pardons Robin Hood, forgives the villagers' taxes, and imprisons Prince John, Sir Hiss, and the Sheriff of Nottingham for their crimes. Robin and Maid Marian are married and ride off together, with Little John and Skippy in tow.
