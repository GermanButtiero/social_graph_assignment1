==Plot==
In April 1862, Cpl. [[William Pittenger]] and several other soldiers, including [[William Hunter Campbell|William Campbell]] are posted outside Nashville under orders from [[Ormsby M. Mitchel|General Mitchell]]. Andrews rides in to speak to Mitchell, who assigns him the mission of hijacking a train behind Confederate lines and destroying the bridges along the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] in order to delay reinforcements against Mitchell's planned attack on [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], as well as cripple the Confederate army's supply lines, possibly putting an end to the war. Pittenger, Campbell, and more soldiers meet Andrews the next night on a hillside where he tells them to arrive in [[Marietta, Georgia]] by April 10. Over the next days, the men travel south through Confederate territory in small groups so as not to draw suspicion. Pittenger and Campbell rendezvous with Andrews and two others at an inn on the [[Tennessee River]], but rain causes Andrews to delay the attempt for a day.

On the morning of April 12, Andrews and the raiders congregate in a railroad hotel in Marietta. They board a northbound train, pulled on that day by the [[The General (locomotive)|''General'']], a locomotive waiting for the breakfast stop at [[Kennesaw, Georgia|Big Shanty]]. While on the train, Andrews is approached by the conductor [[William Allen Fuller|William A. Fuller]], who is suspicious about the men he boarded with. Andrews shows Fuller a letter from [[Brigadier General]] [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Beauregard]]. This convinces Fuller that Andrews and his men are Confederate agents. While the passengers and crew eat, Andrews and the men drop the passenger cars, hijack [[The General (locomotive)|the engine]], and proceed north. Witnessing this, Fuller pursues them on foot along with engineer Jeff Cain and foreman Anthony Murphy. Andrews and the men continue on, pulling up track to block any trains from the south and cutting telegraph wires to stop any towns ahead of them from being alerted. Fuller and his men continue to pursue the raiders; first on foot, then by handcar, then on the small yard engine [[The Yonah (locomotive)|''Yonah'']].

The raiders make their scheduled stop at [[Kingston, Georgia|Kingston]] to wait for a southbound freight train. Andrews disguises their mission from the suspicious station staff by claiming that he is running an extra ammunition supply train to Beauregard. Once the southbound train arrives, the raiders learn, to their surprise, that Mitchell had captured [[Huntsville, Tennessee|Huntsville]] ahead of schedule and the Confederates are now running extra freight trains down south, including another train coming in from the north unscheduled. After 45 minutes of extra waiting, the last train arrives, and the raiders continue north. Fuller and his men eventually reach Kingston. After alerting the station master of the situation, Fuller and his men take a locomotive, the ''William R. Smith'', waiting on the side track and continue until reaching another section of removed track. Fuller and Murphy then wave down Pete Bracken and his southbound express freight and continue the chase with his engine, the [[The Texas (locomotive)|''Texas'']] running in reverse.

The raiders try to stop their pursuers but only slow them down. The raiders arrive at the first bridge and attempt to burn it down by lighting a boxcar and setting the brake it so as to prevent it from being moved. Fuller disables the brake and the ''Texas'' pushes the car out, leaving the bridge intact. With the General out of wood and water and unable to continue, Andrews decides to stop and fight, but before they can, Confederate cavalry from [[Ringgold, Georgia|Ringgold]] approach, sent by [[Danville Leadbetter|General Leadbetter]] after Fuller got a telegraph sent ahead of the raiders. Fuller arrives and reclaims his train as the raiders, having failed in their mission, flee into the wilderness and try to make it back home.

Over the next week, the raiders are hunted down and captured. The group is transferred from jail to jail across the south, ultimately learning that they have been found guilty and are to be hanged soon. One day, while in their cell in Atlanta, one of them manages to break the group's chains. They plan to escape the next morning. All men make it over the wall of the jail yard except Andrews and Campbell, who stay behind to fight off their captors. Eight of the raiders, including Pittenger, manage to escape while the rest are recaptured. Before his execution, Andrews requests a final visit from Fuller, who begrudgingly shows up. Andrews expresses hopes that Fuller will not hold a grudge for deceiving him, acknowledging that they both fought in their own ways. Andrews laments that he will not live to see the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|end of the war]], when both sides come together and shake hands. He asks Fuller if they could do so instead. Fuller obliges, marking the end of their war and putting Andrews at peace.

On March 25, 1863, the eight surviving raiders are summoned to the US War Department and are brought before War Secretary [[Edwin Stanton]] to receive the first [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]]. Stanton says that their perished comrades will also receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, with the exception of Andrews who is ineligible due to being a civilian operative (also excluding William Campbell). Pittenger thanks Stanton on behalf of all of the raiders.
