==Plot==
[[File:Herbie car.jpg|thumb|Original car used during filming of ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'']]
Jim Douglas, his partner and mechanic Wheely Applegate, and Herbie arrive in Paris to qualify for and compete in the Trans-France Race (a fictional version of the [[Monte Carlo Rally]]), in the hopes of staging a career comeback. The team has three major opponents in the race: Bruno von Stickle ([[Eric Braeden]]), a German driver with experience in the "European Racing Circuit", Claude Gilbert (Mike Kulcsar), a French driver, and Diane Darcy ([[Julie Sommars]]), a beautiful young woman and the only female driver in the Trans-France Race.

Herbie falls in love at first sight with Giselle, Diane's sentient [[Lancia Scorpion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22486/lot/137/?category=list|work=[[Bonhams]]|title=1976 LANCIA SCORPION|date=November 23, 2015|access-date=May 22, 2020}}</ref> Diane initially hates Jim for what was apparently his, but actually was Herbie's knee-jerk behavior that ruin her chances of succeeding during the first qualifying rounds, as strong-willed Diane does not appear to believe in any cars that can be alive and have a mind of their own. Herbie and Giselle go on a 'date' together, and the following day, both cars qualify successfully for the race, Herbie performing donuts across the line in a bid to impress Giselle.

Meanwhile, two diamond thieves, Max ([[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]]) and Quincy ([[Roy Kinnear]]), steal the famous ''Étoile de Joie'' (French for "Star of Joy") diamond and hide it in Herbie's fuel tank in order to avoid being captured by a swarm of searching policemen. They attempt to steal Herbie to retrieve the diamond, but Herbie causes them to blow every chance they get. The pair even threaten Jim and Wheely at gunpoint, an encounter from which Herbie manages to escape by driving through a gypsy camp and a building site. Wheely assumes Diane hired the two goons to knock them out of the race, causing a misunderstanding between Jim and Diane. Herbie is also taken into protection by the French police, headed by inspector Bouchet ([[Jacques Marin]]) and his eager junior officer Fontenoy ([[Xavier Saint-Macary]]), causing them to miss the start of the race the following day. Giselle also refuses to start the race without Herbie, much to Diane's exasperation, but does so after Wheely lies to Giselle that Herbie has broken up with her. When Fontenoy eventually arrives with Herbie, Wheely also lies to Herbie that Giselle did the same to persuade Herbie to start the race, albeit from last place.

After numerous setbacks and delays, including another run in with the thieves, Herbie, Jim and Wheely race back into contention. After Diane and Giselle crash into a lake, Herbie turns around and charges back to save them, after Jim reveals Wheely had lied to him. After being rescued by Herbie and Jim, Diane's attitude toward Jim softens, and Diane begins to understand that cars can have minds of their own. Herbie refuses to restart because of being determined to stay with Giselle, but Diane encourages Herbie not to relent in the quest for victory in the Trans-France Race, but not before Herbie makes Wheely get down on his knees and apologize for lying to him. With Diane now out of the race, the three pursue Bruno through the streets of Monte Carlo, leading to a thrilling duel for the win. Herbie takes the lead by driving upside down on the tunnel roof of the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] circuit, and Jim drives Herbie to victory.

After the race, it is revealed that Bouchet, also known as "Double X" as a code name to the thieves, is the real mastermind behind the museum robbery, though the motive of his scheme is revealed as he also threatens Jim and Wheely at gunpoint, only to be foiled by Herbie rolling onto his foot and knocking the gun out of his hands with his hood. Fontenoy, having himself unraveled the mystery of the ''Étoile de Joie'', has Bouchet clapped in handcuffs and arrested.

In the end, Jim and Diane begin to be in love, as so does Wheely and the Monte Carlo trophy girl. Most of all, Herbie and Giselle fall in love again as well and celebrate Herbie's victory by watching a brilliant firework display over the Monte Carlo harbor.
