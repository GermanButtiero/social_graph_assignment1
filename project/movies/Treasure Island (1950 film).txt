PLOT: 
In the West Coast of England in 1765, young Jim Hawkins lives with his mother in a tiny country inn that they run. Captain William Bones, a sickly lodger, gives Jim a treasure map after being visited by two pirates, the second of whom gives the captain a note marked with the black spot, and sends him for help with a mysterious promise to share. Jim returns with Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, only to find Bones dead at the inn, and Jim shows Trelawney the map. Trelawney recognizes the map as belonging to the pirate  Captain Flint and bankrolls a voyage to discover the Flint's lost treasure. Trelawney hires Captain Smollett and his ship, the ''Hispaniola'', bringing Dr. Livesey as the ship's doctor and Jim as the cabin boy.

Before departure, Long John Silver, a one-legged innkeeper, agrees to gather a crew and joins the expedition as the ship's cook. Smollett is concerned about the crew, especially because the nature of their journey is common knowledge. At sea, Silver convinces Jim to acquire some rum, which he uses to inebriate first mate Mr. Arrow so that he is washed overboard in a storm. Later, Jim overhears Silver and the crew's plan to mutiny, discovering that the seamen hired by Silver are Captain Flint's old crew. Jim reveals the treachery to Smollett, who asks Jim to maintain his friendship with Silver to learn more. Upon reaching Treasure Island, Silver offers to tow the ship to a safer anchorage, using two of the ship's rowboats. While the ship is being towed, one of Silver's men, Merry, leads a mutiny on the ship. Smollett, having been warned of the plot by Jim, can repel them with the few men loyal to him and imprisons the mutineers below decks. Silver cuts the rowboats from the ''Hispaniola'' and heads toward the shore with the rest of his men, taking Jim as a hostage. Smollett, Trelawney and Livesey go ashore after them, leaving two guards on the ship.

On Treasure Island, Jim escapes and meets Ben Gunn, marooned by Flint five years ago. Gunn shows Jim the boat that he has built and leads him to Flint's stockade, where he meets Smollett and the others. Merry escapes, takes the ship and raises the Jolly Roger. Silver returns to the ''Hispaniola'', arms his men and plans to take the stockade. Short of men, Silver attempts to parlay with Smollett, but when he is rebuffed, Silver calls his men to attack. The assault on the stockade fails, but Silver wounds Smollett. Although seemingly protected by the stockade, Smollett surmises that, with the morning tide, Silver could move the ''Hispaniola'' into cannon range and level the fort.

Jim takes Gunn's boat and cuts the ''Hispaniola''s anchor rope. The pirate Israel Hands discovers Jim and chases him into the ship's rigging. Hands injures Jim's arm with a knife but is killed by the boy's pistol. The ''Hispaniola'' runs aground, and Jim strikes the Jolly Roger and hoists the Union Jack. Slowed by his wound, which becomes infected by swamp water, it takes him all night to return to the unguarded stockade. Inside the stockade, Jim searches for the doctor to mend his wound, but the man asleep under Livesey's coat is Long John Silver, causing Jim to faint on the spot. Silver finds the map on Jim as his men awaken. Merry wants Jim dead, but Silver wants to trade him for the map, which his men believe is with Smollett. The men go outside to vote. From the stockade's lookout, while calling for Livesey, Silver sees that the ship is aground and flying the Union Jack, and believes that Smollett's partners have recaptured the ship. The other pirates give Silver the black spot, but he refuses to acknowledge it. They let him bargain with Livesey, who has come to treat Jim, for the map.

Silver secretly barters with Livesey for leniency in court, inadvertently revealing that the ship is no longer under his control. Livesey agrees only when Jim refuses to try to escape with him, as Silver had saved his life by calling for Livesey. Livesey leaves and Silver returns with Jim, flaunting the map to convince his men that his bargain was successful. The pirates are overjoyed and retake the black spot, then proceed on a grueling treasure hunt. When they finally reach the spot where the £700,000 treasure is supposed to be buried, they discover instead an empty pit, save for one guinea. The pirates attack Silver, who kills three of them before Smollett's men appear to defeat the rest. Greeting Silver, Gunn reveals that he  has unearthed Flint's treasure and stashed it in a cave. 
 
Despite keeping his end of the bargain, Captain Smollett still wants Silver returned to England to stand trial for his mutiny. Hawkins, Trelawney and two others take Silver to the ''Hispaniola'' aboard a rowboat loaded with a few chests of treasure. Silver snatches Jim's pistol and forces Trelawney and the others from the boat but commands Jim to remain in order to steer him out of the cove. Jim instead beaches him on a sandbar, and Silver orders him to push him at gunpoint, but Jim refuses. Silver is unable to execute his threat to shoot and drops the pistol in the water, attempting to push the boat off on his own. Seeing Silver struggle, Jim helps him, waving a hesitant farewell as Silver rows away with the treasure and bids him farewell in return.
