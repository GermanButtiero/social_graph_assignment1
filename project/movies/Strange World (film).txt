==Plot==
In the land of Avalonia, which is surrounded by an endless wall of mountains, Jaeger Clade and his son, Searcher brave the wilderness to explore new worlds. While trying to traverse the mountains to find a way across it, Searcher discovers a green plant that gives off energy. He and the rest of the expedition team decide to return to Avalonia with the plant while Jaeger angrily continues his mission alone.

25 years later, Searcher has made a name for himself by introducing the miracle plant, dubbed Pando, as a fuel source for Avalonia. He and his wife Meridian are Pando farmers while their son Ethan has a crush on his friend Diazo and chafes at his father's expectation of becoming a farmer like him. One night, Callisto Mal, the president of Avalonia and one of Jeager's former expedition teammates, shows up in her airship, the ''Venture'', to inform the Clades that Pando is losing its power and asks Searcher to help find the cause. He joins an expedition to travel into a giant sinkhole in which the roots of Pando have been located.

On the way down, Meridian tries catching up in her [[Aerial application|crop-duster]] when Ethan and their three-legged dog Legend stows away on the ''Venture''. The ''Venture'', attacked by red [[wyvern]]-like creatures, crash-lands in a subterranean world, where Searcher and Legend are separated from the group. They are attacked by a creature called a "Reaper", but are rescued by Jaeger who has been living underground all these years. He has been trying to cross the mountains from below, but is blocked by an acidic ocean and states his intention to board the ''Venture'' to attempt to cross it.

Meanwhile, Ethan sneaks away from the ''Venture'' to find Searcher. He befriends an amorphous blue creature, naming it Splat, before being reunited with Searcher, Legend, and Jaeger. They are attacked by more Reapers, but are rescued by Meridian and President Callisto and return to the ''Venture''. Searcher insists on completing their mission, while Jaeger wants to continue journeying across the Strange World. Ethan becomes frustrated with them and their opposing worldviews. After another wild encounter, Searcher and Jaeger finally have a heart-to-heart talk and realize that they do respect each other's goals in life. They eventually find a cluster of Pando's roots, which is being attacked by the Strange World's creatures. When Searcher learns that Ethan wants to explore more of the Strange World, he blames Jaeger's influence on him. Ethan angrily jumps off the ''Venture'' and on to one of the Reapers, while Searcher follows him aboard a small flying vehicle. As they are reconciling, they realize that they have passed through the mountains to the ocean beyond where they see the eye of a [[World Turtle|giant turtle-like creature]]. The two realize that Avalonia is on the creature's back and that they have been traveling through its body, meaning that the Reapers and all the other creatures are its immune system.

Seeing that Pando is an infection attacking the creature's heart, they head back to inform the expedition team that Pando must be destroyed, but President Callisto has them locked up to prevent them from stopping the mission while Jaeger furiously sails off to see for himself. After Legend and Splat free the family, Searcher and Ethan head to the creature's heart to clear a path for the Reapers, while Meridian takes over the ship and convinces President Callisto to help. Jaeger returns and with his help, they break through Pando and the creatures appear and destroy it, bringing the heart back to life and saving the land.

One year later, Ethan and Diazo are in a relationship as they and their friends collect resources from the underground, and Avalonia shifts from Pando energy to [[wind turbine]]s. Jaeger visits his ex-wife Penelope, who has remarried during his absence, while his relationship with Searcher improves as they run the farm. The camera zooms away from Avalonia to show the giant turtle-like creature on an ocean-covered planet.
