PLOT: Both of the film's animated segments are introduced through live-action scenes set in a library as a framing device. The first segment (based on Kenneth Grahame's novel ''The Wind in the Willows'') is introduced and narrated by Basil Rathbone; the second segment (based on Washington Irving's short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow") is introduced and narrated by Bing Crosby. Both narrators preface their stories by mentioning various literary characters from both English and American literature, before settling on the characters of Mr. Toad and Ichabod respectively for their tales.
