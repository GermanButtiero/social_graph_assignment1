==Plot==
Both of the film's animated segments are introduced through live-action scenes set in a library as a [[Frame story|framing device]]. The first segment (based on [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'') is introduced and narrated by [[Basil Rathbone]]; the second segment (based on [[Washington Irving]]'s short story "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]") is introduced and narrated by [[Bing Crosby]]. Both narrators preface their stories by mentioning various literary characters from both English and American literature, before settling on the characters of Mr. Toad and Ichabod respectively for their tales.

=== ''The Wind in the Willows'' ===
In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1905, [[Mr. Toad|J. Thaddeus Toad]] is the wealthy owner of the Toad Hall estate in London, England, whose adventures and positive [[mania]] for various fads have brought him to the brink of bankruptcy. One of Toad's friends, Angus MacBadger, volunteers as an [[accountant]] to help Toad keep the estate, which is the pride of the community. One summer day, MacBadger asks Toad's best friends, Water Rat and Mole, to persuade him to give up his latest mania of recklessly driving around the countryside in a [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|gypsy cart]] pulled by his horse Cyril Proudbottom, which is accumulating financial liability in damaged property. Rat and Mole confront Toad and unsuccessfully try to change his mind. Toad then sees a [[Brass Era car|motor car]] for the first time and is taken over by motor mania.

To keep him out of trouble, Rat and Mole lock Toad in his bedroom, but he escapes and is soon charged with [[Motor vehicle theft|car theft]]. At his trial, Toad [[Litigant in person|represents himself]], with Cyril as his first witness. Cyril testifies that the car which Toad was accused of taking had been stolen by a gang of weasels. Unaware of this, Toad found weasels in a [[tavern]] and offered to buy the car from them, but since he had no money, he traded Toad Hall for the car. The court shows disbelief at the statement, so Toad calls Mr. Winky, the barman from the tavern, to testify in his favor. When Winky instead implicates Toad in trying to sell him the stolen car, Toad is found guilty on the spot and sentenced to imprisonment in the [[Tower of London]]. His friends try to appeal his case, but to no avail.

On [[Christmas Eve]], Cyril visits Toad and helps him escape by giving him a [[disguise]]. Toad hijacks an [[steam locomotive|engine]] from a railway station and heads to the riverbank, where he hides in the Rat's house after escaping from the police. MacBadger visits to tell them the that the weasel gang has taken over Toad Hall, with Winky as their leader, confirming that Toad had indeed traded his estate for the stolen car. To prove his innocence before the law, Toad, McBadger, Rat, and Mole sneak into the estate and narrowly manage to take the deed (bearing Toad and Winky's signatures) away from the weasels after a chase around Toad Hall.

Toad is exonerated and regains his house, but develops a mania for planes. As MacBadger, Rat, and Mole celebrate the [[New Year's Day]], Toad and Cyril recklessly fly past on a [[Wright Flyer]].

=== ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' ===
In 1790, [[Ichabod Crane]] arrives in the small [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] village of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] to be the new [[schoolmaster]]. Due to his odd appearance and [[effeminate]] mannerisms, Ichabod becomes a target for the local bully, Brom Bones, but forms good relationships with his students and the village's women. Ichabod soon meets and falls in love with Katrina, the daughter of wealthy farmer Baltus Van Tassel, while also having one eye on her family's fortune. Brom, who intends to marry Katrina, proceeds to compete for her affection with the schoolmaster, but Ichabod wins Katrina over at every opportunity, with Katrina noticing Brom's increasing anger and jealousy.

Ichabod and Brom are invited to Van Tassel's annual [[Halloween]] frolic, where Brom tries in vain to keep Ichabod and Katrina separate. Discovering that Ichabod is [[superstition|superstitious]], Brom tells the tale of the [[Headless Horseman]] who, every Halloween night, travels through the woods searching for a living head to replace the one he lost; the only way to escape him is to cross a [[covered bridge]], at which point he will vanish. Katrina and all the guests find the story amusing, but Ichabod is left terrified. 

That night, Ichabod rides his horse Gunpowder home through the Hollow where the Headless Horseman is said to appear; remembering the story, his fear and anxiety heighten and he is frightened by every sound he hears. Passing through the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow|old European cemetery]], Ichabod becomes convinced he can hear the sound of a galloping horse approaching, but bursts into laughter when it turns out to be [[typha|cattails]] bumping on a log. His laughter is cut short when the real Headless Horseman appears, mounted on a fiery black horse and carrying [[jack-o'-lantern]] and a [[sword]]. Ichabod and Gunpowder run off and, remembering Brom's story, ride towards a covered bridge with the Horseman in pursuit. They finally cross the bridge but as Ichabod looks back, the Horseman throws the jack-o'-lantern in his direction.

The next morning, Ichabod's hat and a shattered pumpkin are found near the bridge, but there was no trace of the schoolmaster. Subsequently, Brom marries Katrina, and rumors persist that Ichabod survived and married a wealthy [[widow]] in a distant county, though the [[Dutch Americans|Dutch settlers]] remain certain he was spirited away by the Headless Horseman. The ending of the story prompts the film's [[narrator]] to exclaim: "Man, I'm gettin' outta here."
