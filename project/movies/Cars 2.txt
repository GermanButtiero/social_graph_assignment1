==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words -->
British spy [[Finn McMissile]] infiltrates an [[oil platform|oil rig]] in the Pacific Ocean owned by criminal [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon cars]] to rescue fellow spy Leland Turbo. He witnesses the lemons, seemingly led by [[Germany|German]] weapons designer [[Professor Zündapp]], loading an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) generator disguised as a [[TV camera]] onto a shipping crate. After discovering Turbo's death at the hands of the lemons, Finn is exposed and he escapes by faking his death.

After winning his fourth Piston Cup honoring the late Doc Hudson, [[Lightning McQueen]] returns to [[Radiator Springs]] to spend the off-season with his friends. Italian [[formula racing|formula]] race car [[Francesco Bernoulli]] challenges Lightning to participate in the World Grand Prix, an international three-race event created by former oil tycoon [[Sir Miles Axlerod]], who intends to promote his new environmentally friendly fuel, Allinol. Lightning and his best friend [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], along with [[Luigi (Cars)|Luigi]], [[Guido (Cars)|Guido]], [[Fillmore (Cars)|Fillmore]], and Sarge, depart for [[Tokyo]], where the first race takes place.

At a World Grand Prix promotional event, Mater makes a scene after eating [[wasabi]] he mistakes for ice cream and seemingly leaking oil on stage, embarrassing Lightning. While cleaning up, Mater interrupts a fight between American spy Rod "Torque" Redline, who is tasked with delivering intel to Finn, and lemons Grem and Acer. Redline plants a device on Mater, causing Finn and his associate [[Holley Shiftwell]] to believe Mater is their contact. Meanwhile, Redline is captured and killed by Zündapp, who reveals that Allinol ignites when hit with an EMP. He informs his superior, an unknown mastermind, that Redline passed on his information. Holley recruits Mater to stop Zündapp's plot, believing him to be an undercover agent.

During the race, three racers are ignited by the camera. Lightning places second in the race due to miscommunication with Mater, who was evading Zündapp's henchmen with Holley's instructions. Lightning confronts him at the pits, snapping at him and declaring he doesn't want his help. A guilt-ridden Mater prepares to return to Radiator Springs, but is taken by Finn, and they escape from the lemons in his jet, Siddeley. After traveling to [[Paris]] to gather intel from Finn's old friend Tomber, they head to Porto Corsa, [[Italy]], where the second race takes place. Mater infiltrates the lemons' meeting as the camera ignites more racers, causing a multi-car pile-up, while Lightning wins. Due to controversy over Allinol's safety, Axlerod lifts its requirement for use in the final race in [[London]]. When Lightning decides to continue using it, the lemons plan to kill him during the race. This spooks Mater into blowing his cover, causing him, Finn, and Holley to be captured and tied up inside [[Big Ben]]tley, where he admits to them that he is not the spy they think he is.

As the race starts, Lightning takes the lead before passing Big Bentley, but the camera inexplicably does not ignite him. The lemons tell Mater that they planted a [[time bomb]] in Lightning's pits as a backup plan, spurring him to escape. Finn and Holley escape but realize that the lemons fitted the bomb on Mater's air filter instead. As Mater is informed of this, he flees down the track and Lightning pursues him to apologize for his outburst, while Finn apprehends Zündapp. The other lemons arrive and outnumber Finn, Holley, Mater, and Lightning, but they are rescued by the other Radiator Springs residents and Sarge's colleagues in the [[British Army]]. Mater and Lightning go to [[Buckingham Palace]], where Mater exposes Axlerod as the mastermind, proven when he is forced to disable the bomb. It is revealed that the World Grand Prix was Axlerod's cover-up to turn the world against alternative fuels and profit from his ownership of the world's untouched oil reserves. Axlerod and the lemons are arrested, Mater receives an honorary [[Knighthood (United Kingdom)|knighthood]] from the Queen, and he and Lightning reconcile.

Back in Radiator Springs, as Mater tells everyone about his experience, Filmore and Sarge reveal that they had swapped the Allinol with Filmore's own organic biofuel prior to the London race, explaining the camera's ineffectiveness on Lightning. The "Radiator Springs Grand Prix" is held, featuring the World Grand Prix contenders. Finn and Holley invite Mater to go on another mission, but he declines, Holley promises Mater she'll be back for their first date. While his weapons are confiscated, Mater keeps the rockets and speeds off with Lightning as Siddeley flies into the distance.
