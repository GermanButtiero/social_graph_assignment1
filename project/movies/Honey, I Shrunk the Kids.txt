==Plot==
<!-- Plot summaries should be between 400-700 words. Count at 656 (August 2025) -->
[[Scientist]] and inventor Wayne Szalinski has been designing an [[shrink ray|energy-projecting machine intended to shrink and grow objects]], but it instead explodes them. Wayne has yet to figure out how to fix it, and his obsession with the machine worries his hardworking wife, realtor Diane, 15-year-old teenage daughter Amy, and 11-year-old aspiring inventor son Nick. Next door, Big Russ Thompson, his wife Mae, and their 12-year-old younger son Ron are preparing for a fishing trip. Their 15-year-old elder son, Little Russ Thompson, is less than enthusiastic, as his interests often clash with his father's.

Shortly after Wayne leaves for a conference, Ron accidentally hits a [[baseball]] through the Szalinski's attic window and into the machine, turning it on and blocking its targeting laser which fortutiously fixes the shrinking function. Caught by his brother, Ron is forced to confess to Amy and Nick. Ron and Nick enter the attic in an attempt to retrieve the ball, but the machine shrinks them. Amy and Little Russ later suffer the same fate when they go searching for their siblings.

At his conference, Wayne is laughed off the stage for failing to provide proof that his machine works. He enters the attic upon returning home; the shrunken children try to get his attention, but their voices are only loud enough to be heard by the family dog, Quark. Already frustrated, Wayne discovers the broken window and snaps, repeatedly striking the machine. He sweeps the debris, along with the kids, into a dustpan and a trash bag. The four manage to escape, only to discover that the trash bag is now at the curb; they make their way back home through the Szalinski's overgrown yard.  While trying to get back, they have a harrowing encounter with a [[bee]], which separates them.

Meanwhile, the Thompson and Szalinski parents become uneasy at their children's absence. Big Russ and Mae cancel their fishing trip and file a missing persons report with the police. Wayne returns to the attic, sees the machine now works, and deduces it shrunk the kids. Realizing what he did, he goes to the yard, sees they escaped the trash bag, and gently searches the grass, but accidentally activates some sprinklers. As a result, Amy nearly drowns in a [[mud]] puddle, but Little Russ dives in to pull her out and revive her with [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|rescue breaths]]. Wayne eventually reveals the truth to Diane, and she joins in the search. Later, she convinces Wayne to share the information with the Thompsons, but they remain skeptical.

The kids feast on one of Nick's discarded [[Oatmeal Creme Pie]] cookies, and use a crumb to capture a friendly [[Ant#Communication|forager ant]], naming it "Antie" and riding it toward the house. As night falls, the group takes shelter in a [[Lego]] piece. Amy and Little Russ begin to express feelings for one another and share a kiss. The kids are suddenly attacked by a [[scorpion]], but Antie dies while rescuing them from it.

The next morning, Nick's friend Tommy arrives to mow the lawn. The kids are forced to seek shelter in an [[earthworm]] tunnel, barely escaping the vortex caused by the mower, which Wayne and Diane shut off just in time. The kids hitch a ride on Quark and enter the house, but Nick falls into a bowl of [[Cheerios]] and is nearly eaten by his father. Quark bites Wayne's ankle to get his attention; Wayne discovers the kids' presence and works to repair the machine.

Both families meet in the attic, and the kids use [[charades]] to inform Wayne that the baseball blocked the laser, which previously overheated targets and caused them to explode. Wayne corrects the problem, and Big Russ volunteers as a test subject; after the test succeeds, he and the kids are restored to their original sizes.

Months later at [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], the Szalinskis and Thompsons have become good friends and are toasting over an enlarged turkey, while Quark feasts on an enlarged [[dog biscuit]].
