PLOT: Set mainly in 1913, the film is about Francis Ouimet, the first amateur to win the U.S. Open. Amateur golf in that era was a sport only for the wealthy, and Francis came from an Irish and French-Canadian immigrant family that was part of the working class. Francis watches an exhibition by legendary Jersey golf pro Harry Vardon as a 7-year-old boy, and becomes very interested in golf. He begins as a caddie at The Country Club, a posh enclave located across the street from his home in suburban Brookline, Massachusetts, while making friends with the other caddies. He works on his own golf game at every chance, and gradually accumulates his own set of clubs. Francis practices putting at night in his room. He wins the Massachusetts Schoolboy Championship.

One day, a club member, Mr. Hastings, asks Francis to play with him over The Country Club course, where caddies have almost no access of their own, and he shoots a fine round of 81 despite a 9 on one hole. His talent, composure, and good manners earn admirers and interest. With the help of Mr. Hastings and the Club Caddiemaster, Francis gets a chance to play in an upcoming tournament, the U.S. Amateur, the local qualifying which is to be held at the very same Country Club course. However, his father Arthur tells him to quit golf and get a "real job". Francis needs $50 for the entry fee, and so agrees to get a real job and never play golf again if he cannot qualify; his father lends him the money. On the 18th, Francis faces a three-foot putt that would secure him a spot in the championship, but he looks over and his father is watching. Francis is distracted, misses and falls one stroke short of qualifying for the championship proper.

With much jeer from the rich folk, Francis, now 20, fulfills his promise to his father and works at a sporting goods shop, while continuing to live at home. After some time with his golf forgotten, Francis is still at the bottom of the working class. But one day, the president of the United States Golf Association enters the store and personally invites him to play in the upcoming U.S. Open. After some maneuvering and consideration from his employer, Francis secures entry. Arthur informs him that he must find his own place to live after the tournament, and Francis agrees to this arrangement. However, his mother Mary, having been supportive of Francis's interest in golf from the start, admonishes Arthur for failing to recognize Francis's talent and the value of showcasing that talent in an important tournament.

Francis competes in the 1913 U.S. Open that takes place at The Country Club. The favorites are British champions Vardon and Ted Ray, who are accompanied by the snobbish Lord Northcliffe, and the reigning U.S. Open champion, John McDermott. Northcliffe looks to see that either Vardon or Ray wins the Open, to affirm British dominance over the Americans in golf, and also to prove that only gentlemen are able champions. Francis competes with his 10-year-old friend, Eddie Lowery, who skips school to caddie for Francis. After the first two rounds, Vardon and Ray have a seemingly comfortable lead, with McDermott unable to keep up. After some initial struggles, Francis rallies and ultimately ties with Vardon and Ray at the conclusion of the fourth round, resulting in the three of them competing in an 18-hole playoff to determine the champion. The night before, Northcliffe mocks Francis's social status to Vardon. Exasperated, Vardon, who hails from humble beginnings himself, angrily tells Northcliffe that if Francis wins, it will be solely due to his skill, not his background. Vardon also reminds Northcliffe that a gentleman would not begrudge Francis the respect he deserves.

The playoff round begins, with all three competitors neck and neck until the back nine, where Ray begins to fall behind, leaving Francis leading Vardon by a single stroke as they approach the final hole. Vardon concludes with a par, setting the stage for Francis to secure victory with a par of his own. Sensing Francis's nerves before the crucial putt, Eddie offers reassurance, enabling Francis to sink the putt and claim the U.S. Open title. Amidst the jubilant crowd lifting them on their shoulders, individuals start offering money to Francis, who graciously declines all but one bill, offered by his proud father. Inside the clubhouse, Vardon extends his private congratulations to Francis and proposes a friendly round together in the future. Francis and Eddie make their way home proudly carrying the U.S. Open trophy.

The epilogue explains that Harry Vardon went on to win his sixth British Open Championship the following year, Francis Ouimet won two amateur championships and became a businessman, and Eddie Lowery became a multi-millionaire, remaining lifelong friends with Francis.
