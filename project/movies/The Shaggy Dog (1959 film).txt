== Plot ==
Wilbur "Wilby" Daniels is a boy who creates often dangerous inventions. As a retired mailman who often ran afoul of canines, Wilby's father Wilson hates dogs, and cannot understand why his younger son, Montgomery "Moochie" Daniels, wants one.

Wilby and his rival Buzz Miller go with French girl Francesca Andrassy to a museum. Buzz and Francesca eventually leave without Wilby. He later encounters Professor Plumcutt, whose newspaper Wilby used to deliver. Plumcutt mentions mystical ancient beliefs, including the legend of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia family]], who used [[shape-shifting]] as a weapon against their enemies.

Wilby later collides with a table that holds a display case of jewelry. He accidentally ends up with one of the rings in the cuff of his pants. It is the cursed Borgia ring, and after reading the [[inscription]] on it ("''In canis corpore transmuto''{{-"}}, which, unknown to Wilby, means, "Into a dog's body I change"), he transforms into Chiffon, Francesca's [[Old English Sheepdog]]. Confused, Wilby, as a dog, goes to Plumcutt, who says that the Borgia curse can only be broken through a heroic act of selflessness. After getting chased out of his own house by an enraged Wilson, who fails to recognize him as a dog, Wilby continues to switch back and forth between human form and dog form. Only Moochie and Plumcutt know his true identity, as Wilby has spoken to them both in dog form.

Francesca sees that Chiffon has been acting strangely. She asks her adoptive father, Dr. Andrassy, to watch over Chiffon for the night. Wilby, as a dog, eventually overhears Dr. Valasky and his associate Thurm discuss plans to steal a government secret.

The next day, Wilby, as a dog, tells Moochie about the spies. Wilby reveals the secret to his dumbfounded father. As Wilby and Moochie discuss what to do next, Francesca's butler Stefano drags Wilby into the house. Moochie runs to his father to get help, who goes to the authorities, until Wilson finds himself accused of being either crazy or a spy.

Stefano and Andrassy later discuss plans to steal a government secret, and Wilby, as a dog, overhears. He however transforms into human Wilby in front of the spies and is discovered, but not before he hears Andrassy expressing his wish to get rid of Francesca.

The spies force Francesca to leave with them, leaving the human Wilby bound and gagged in the closet. Moochie sneaks into the house and discovers Wilby, who has once again transformed into a dog.

When Buzz appears at the residence to take Francesca on a date, Wilby, still in his dog form, steals Buzz's hot rod automobile. Buzz reports this to officers Hansen and Kelly, who report the suspect as a "large shaggy dog" This is sighted by two policemen who decide to aid Kelly and Hansen. Wilson and Moochie follow Buzz and the police, who end up chasing everyone. The spies attempt to leave aboard a boat, but the police call in the [[water police]] to apprehend Andrassy and stop his boat. Wilby, in his dog form, swims up and wrestles with the men, as Francesca gets knocked out of the boat. Wilby drags her to shore, where Buzz tries to take credit for her rescue. This angers Wilby, who still a dog, attacks Buzz. Wilby's snarling turns into a tirade as Wilby finds himself wrestling with Buzz. Francesca awakens to see a wet Chiffon and hugs it, thinking that he was her rescuer. Noticing that he and Chiffon are seen together, Wilby realizes that he has broken the curse.

Now that Wilson and Chiffon are declared heroes, Francesca can leave for Paris without Andrassy and Stefano, both of whom are arrested for espionage, and she gives Chiffon to the Daniels family as her way of thanking them. Since Wilson has gotten such commendation for foiling a spy ring because of "his love of dogs", he stops hating dogs and allows Moochie to care for Chiffon. Wilby and Buzz decide to forget their rivalry over Francesca and resume their friendship. 
Of course in a final scene Allison (Annette) gets a kind of revenge on Buzz and Wilby for being ignored in favor of Francesca.
