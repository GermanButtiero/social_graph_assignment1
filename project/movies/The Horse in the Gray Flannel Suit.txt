PLOT: Madison Avenue advertising executive Fred Bolton, a Lakeville, Connecticut widower living beyond his means, is beset by two major problems. His boss has instructed him to devise an original campaign in just 24 hours to promote their client Allied Drug & Food's over-the-counter indigestion medication, Aspercel. Allied's chairman Tom Dugan wants a "jet set" appeal campaign that will "give sour stomachs class and dignity".

Fred's other problem is his teenage daughter Helen, who loves horses, takes riding classes and has competed. She dreams of having her own horse but knows that the family cannot afford one and that her father is allergic to horses.

Fred has an idea to solve both problems at once: he will acquire a good horse, name it Aspercel and publicize the horse while Helen rides it. Helen and the horse must first win a few prizes to make the horse a celebrated figure. Fred enlists the help of Helen's riding instructor Suzie, and is assisted by teenager Ronny Gardner, who is smitten with Helen.

Helen wins some ribbons, but the resulting publicity is below Dugan's expectations. When Helen learns that her father's job is at stake, she falters under pressure and fails to win an important show. Suzie realizes Aspercel's potential when the horse carries Fred over a seven-foot wall and away from a police car. She volunteers to ride Aspercel in the International Horse Show and recruits her wealthy friend and equestrian Archer Madison as a trainer. After a close competition with the reigning champion, Suzie and Aspercel win the championship. Fred is rewarded with a promotion and Suzie's love.
