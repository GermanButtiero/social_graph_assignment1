PLOT: In August 1940, during the Blitz, three orphans named Charles, Carrie, and Paul Rawlins are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye near the Dorset coast where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. They attempt to run back to London, but change their minds after observing Miss Price flying on a broomstick. Revealing that she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort against the Nazis, Miss Price offers the children a transportation spell on a bedknob in exchange for their silence, which they accept. Later, she receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces the children to use the bedknob to go to London and locate her teacher Professor Emelius Browne.

Mr. Browne turns out to be a charismatic street magician who created the course from an old book as a joke, only to be shocked to learn that the spells work. He gives the book to Miss Price, who is distraught to discover the final spell, Substitutiary Locomotion, is missing key pages. The group travels to Portobello Road to locate the old bookseller who sold Browne the book; the missing pages reveal that the spell is not in the book, but engraved on the Star of Astoroth, a medallion that belonged to a sorcerer of that name. The bookseller explains that Astoroth experimented with magic on animals before anthropomorphism drove the animals to kill the wizard, take the medallion, and flee to the remote island of Naboombu. According to a notation in the book, a 17th-century lascar had claimed to have seen Naboombu, but the bookseller never found it. Paul confirms its existence by revealing a storybook that he found in Browne's townhouse.

The group travels to Naboombu and lands in a lagoon, where Mr. Browne and Miss Price enter a dance contest and win first prize before the bed is fished out by a bear, who informs the group that humans are not allowed on the island by royal decree. They are brought before the ruler King Leonidas, who is wearing the Star of Astoroth. Mr. Browne acts as a referee in a soccer match in order to appease King Leonidas and the animals' love for the game. The chaotic match ends in King Leonidas' self-proclaimed victory, but Mr. Browne swaps the medallion with his referee whistle, and the group escapes back to Miss Price's house. Miss Price exercises the Substitutiary Locomotion spell, which imbues inanimate objects with life, but they quickly go out of control. When she is informed that the children can be moved to another home, she decides to let them stay, realizing she has come to care for them and vice versa. Mr. Browne later bids goodbye to the group and sleeps at the train station so that he can catch a train back to London in the morning.

A platoon of Nazi German commandos land on the coast via U-boat, invading Miss Price's house to use as their headquarters for a fear-spreading raid while imprisoning her and the children in the local museum. At the train station, Mr. Browne subdues two Nazis and heads back to Miss Price's house, where he turns himself into a white rabbit to avoid the army. Reuniting with Miss Price and the children at the museum, Mr. Browne inspires Miss Price to use the Substitutiary Locomotion spell to enchant the exhibits into an army. The army of knights' armor and military uniforms chases the Nazis away, but not before they destroy Miss Price's workshop, breaking the spell and ending her career as a witch. Despite the setback, Miss Price is happy that she played a small part in the war effort.

Shortly afterward, Miss Price has officially adopted the children while Mr. Browne has enlisted in the army and departs with the local Home Guard escorting him, promising that he will return and sharing a kiss with Miss Price. Paul reveals he still has the enchanted bedknob, implying they can continue on with their adventures.
