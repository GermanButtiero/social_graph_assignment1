==Plot==
In [[Boise, Idaho]] in 1987, [[high school football]] coach Jim White loses his temper and accidentally injures a player in the locker room. As a result, White is fired and has to relocate his family to his new job at [[McFarland High School (California)|McFarland High School]] in [[McFarland, California]], which is predominantly Latino. They have trouble adjusting to the Hispanic neighborhood and lament being unable to afford to live in [[Bakersfield]].

White is first put as assistant football coach but ultimately loses his coaching status after pulling an injured player, Johnny Sameniego, out of a game, causing the crass Head Coach Jenks to ask White to step down.

Discovering that some of his students are strong runners, White has Principal Camillo authorize [[Cross country running|cross-country]] as a sport and organizes an all-boys team. He enlists Sameniego's help and recruits Thomas Valles, Jose Cardenas, Victor Puentes, and brothers David, Damacio, and Danny Diaz. All seven have little hope for their future, specifically Valles, who has hardships with his father and nearly throws himself off a bridge before White stops him. Jim's devotion to the team leads to him alienating his family, including forgetting to pick up his daughter Julie's birthday cake.

After a few regional competitions, the team wins its first race. Shortly afterward, the Diaz brothers are taken off the team by their father, who wants them to work for his team of [[Farmworker|field pickers]] instead. In response, White joins them in the fields one Saturday and convinces them to come to meets and races at earlier and later times of the day, to which they finally address him as "coach". White's wife, Cheryl, organizes a [[tamale]] and car wash sale with the rest of the neighborhood to raise money for new uniforms, where the Whites become better acquainted with the community.

Eventually, the McFarland team competes in and qualifies for the State Tournament, and White takes them to the beach to celebrate. White also makes amends with Julie by throwing her a [[quinceañera]] with help from the community, though it goes wrong when Julie is taken out on "parade" around the town and the group of cars is attacked by another group of street punks.

Despite the group's insistence that Julie was protected, Jim questions his family's safety in McFarland and interviews for a full-time position at [[Palo Alto]] that he was previously offered, upsetting Julie and Thomas. Cheryl implores him to continue to be there for the McFarland team and their friends in the neighborhood, reminding him how much the community has embraced them.

The day of the state championships comes and the whole McFarland community accompanies the team to the race. Because of White's rigorous training and the team's efforts, McFarland upsets the other more favored schools and comes in first. After the race, Jim turns down the Palo Alto position and embraces his family and the team.

A series of texts shows that under White's guidance, the team becomes outstandingly successful, winning nine state titles over 14 years. All the members of the first team become the first in their families to go to college or into military careers. Almost all members continue to attend the practices that Jim White held for successive school cross country teams even after graduation from college. White continued teaching and coaching in McFarland until his retirement in 2003 after which he continued living in McFarland.
