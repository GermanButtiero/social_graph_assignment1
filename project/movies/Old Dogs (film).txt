PLOT: Dan Rayburn and Charlie Reed are best friends and co-owners at a sports marketing firm. Seven years ago, Dan was briefly married to Vicki. In the present, Vicki resurfaces to tell Dan that their short marriage resulted in twins Zach and Emily. Vicki is facing jail for her work as an environmental activist. She asks Dan to take care of the kids while she does her time. Dan agrees, but only if Charlie helps him as neither have any experience taking care of kids. At the same time, they must finalize a deal with a Japanese company.

Charlie and Dan's attempts to take care of the kids are well-intentioned, but very awkward. An overnight camp instructor thinks that Dan and Charlie are homosexual partners. Later on, the kids accidentally spill Charlie and Dan's prescriptions and when they try to put them back, they end up mixing them up, leading to unexpected side effects for both men.

Desperate to help Dan communicate with the children, Charlie recruits his friend Jimmy Lunchbox, a famous children's entertainer. Jimmy straps Dan and Charlie in motion-controlled puppet suits so Charlie can help Dan make the right moves with his daughter while having a tea party. The suits malfunction, but Dan speaks from the heart, winning Emily over. 

Vicki returns home. Dan and Charlie send their junior associate Craig to Tokyo and begin spending more time with the kids. However, Charlie and Dan receive news that Craig has gone missing, so they fly to Tokyo.

Once in Tokyo, Dan realizes he really wants to be a good father, and leaves the meeting without sealing the deal. They rush with Craig, who has returned from Tokyo, to Vermont for the kids' birthday party, but don't get into the Burlington Zoo in time and are forced to break in, encountering an affectionate gorilla and hostile penguins. Dan pays a birthday party performer hired by Vicki for his jet pack, flies into the party, and wins over his kids again. 

One year later, Dan and Vicki are back together, Charlie is married, and Craig has become like an "uncle" to the kids.
