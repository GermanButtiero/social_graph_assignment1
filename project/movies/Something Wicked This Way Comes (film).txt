PLOT: In Green Town, Illinois, two young boys, a reserved Will Halloway, and somewhat rebellious Jim Nightshade, leave from an after-school detention for "whispering in class" and hurry home. The boys live next door to each other and were born a minute apart on Halloween. Will lives with his mother and father Charles while Jim lives with his single mother; it is heavily implied that his father walked out on them. A lightning rod salesman named Tom Fury arrives and sells one to Jim, claiming that it will protect him from an upcoming storm. The boys soon hear of a carnival coming to town led by the ominous Mr. Dark.

The carnival arrives and is set up overnight. Will and Jim notice that many of the residents seem oddly entranced by some of the attractions such as the amputee bartender Ed who sees his missing arm and leg return in a mirror and the boys' teacher Miss Foley who wishes to regain her youth. Will and Jim see a carousel that is closed off and are confronted by Mr. Dark, who quickly becomes suspicious of them. Later, they witness Mr. Dark using the carousel on his assistant, Mr. Cooger, who reverts to a little boy. Will and Jim head off to see Foley, but she is with her "nephew", who is actually Cooger, and are forced to leave.

Foley suddenly becomes younger, but loses her vision and is taken by Cooger to Dark. Will gets into an argument with Jim when the latter reveals that he has always been envious of the former being older and wants to use the carousel. They then witness Fury being tortured by Mr. Dark, who wants the secret of the upcoming storm and uses his other assistant, the Dust Witch, to seduce him, but to no avail. The boys run when they are found out and try to go to bed. In the middle of the night, the two are attacked by tarantulas, but the lightning rod that Fury gave Jim earlier saves them.

In the morning, Mr. Dark leads his carnival, now consisting of some of the townspeople, in a parade, though Will and Jim deduce that it is a search party for them. Charles eventually figures out that the boys are in trouble, and when confronted by Mr. Dark, manages to deter him. Charles, Will and Jim head to the library where the former reveals that the carnival had come to town before and that his own father had fought them. Mr. Dark arrives, searching for Will and Jim and offers Charles his youth back, but he resists. He knocks out Charles and makes off with the boys back to the carnival. Charles regains himself and heads to the carnival just as the storm arrives. He runs into Jim's mother and deters her before she too succumbs to Mr. Dark's powers.

Charles heads into the hall of mirrors, where Mr. Dark continues to taunt him about his age. Will declares his love for his father and repels the Dust Witch, allowing Fury to escape his imprisonment and impale her with a lightning rod. Will and Charles find Mr. Dark attempting to use the carousel with Jim in tow, but they rescue him just as lightning strikes the ride. As Mr. Dark begins to age and decay, Will and Charles express happiness to awaken Jim and the three flee with the horses and ponies and the townspeople just as the carnival begins to get sucked away into a giant tornado. Will, Jim and Charles head back into town and begin to happily dance back home, with the danger now over.
