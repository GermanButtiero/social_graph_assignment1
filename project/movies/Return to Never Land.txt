PLOT: Many years after her trip to Neverland, an adult Wendy Darling, who maintains her belief and knowledge of Peter Pan, is married to a soldier named Edward, and becomes a mother, having two children, Jane and Danny. With World War II raging, Edward leaves his family to fight in the war, leaving Wendy to take care of the children. Jane becomes cynical and, unlike her younger brother, refuses to believe in stories about Peter and Neverland.

A few years later, on Danny's fourth birthday, Wendy is informed that the children are scheduled for evacuation to the country the following morning. Jane refuses to go and has an argument with her mother and brother. Later that night, Peter's arch-nemesis, Captain Hook, and his pirate crew arrive on his pixie-dust enchanted ship. Mistaking her for Wendy, she doesn't have time to say that it's not her, that one of Hook's henchmen surprises her from behind and gags her with a scarf while Mr. Smee and the other pirates tie her up and lock her in a bag before hoisting her onto the ship. and takes her to Neverland, where they plan to feed Jane to an octopus to lure Peter into a trap. However, Peter rescues Jane, and Hook escapes from the disgruntled octopus, being in the role of the Crocodile, returning to the ship. After Peter learns that Jane is Wendy's daughter, he takes her to his hideout to be the mother of the Lost Boys as Wendy once was, but Jane refuses. She tries to leave the island by means of a raft, but it sinks, and Peter tells her that the only way to get home is by flying. The following day, the boys fail to teach Jane about flying. Annoyed by their unruly behavior, Jane loses her temper and declares that she does not believe in Neverland, particularly fairies. Her disbelief causes Tinker Bell to lose her strength and the fairy's light begins to fade.

Hook, overhearing Jane's longing to return home, plans to use this to his advantage. That night, Hook promises to bring Jane home if she can find the treasure that Peter and the Lost Boys stole, giving her a whistle to signal him when she finds it. Jane asks Peter and the boys to play a game of "treasure hunt", and they teach Jane how to act like a Lost Boy, hoping to get her to believe in fairies and save Tinker Bell's life. Jane finds the treasure and changes her mind, discarding the whistle. The boys make her a "Lost Girl", before Tootles finds and blows the whistle, inadvertently alerting the pirates, who capture the boys and expose Jane as their accomplice. Jane tries to convince Peter that it was a misunderstanding, but he accuses her of being a traitor and reveals that her disbelief in fairies is causing Tinker Bell's light to fade.

Horrified by her selfish deed, Jane runs back to the hideout to find Tinker Bell's lifeless body. Jane is heartbroken, believing her to be dead, but her newfound belief in fairies revives her. They head to the ship and see Hook forcing Peter to walk the plank. With Tinker Bell's help, Jane learns to fly. As Peter uses the anchor to sink the ship, the pirates, riding on a rowboat, are chased away by the octopus. After saying goodbye to the boys, Peter escorts Jane back home, where she reconciles with Wendy and Danny. Peter and Tinker Bell meet with Wendy again, then fly back to Neverland as Edward returns home and reunites with his family.
