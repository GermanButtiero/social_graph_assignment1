Notorious real estate magnate and [[Building demolition|demolition]] baron Alonzo A. Hawk is ready to build his newest office building, the 130-story Hawk Plaza in San Francisco. The only building remaining on the site is an 1892 [[Fire station|firehouse]] inhabited by Mrs. Steinmetz, widow of its former owner, Fire Captain Steinmetz, and aunt of mechanic [[The Love Bug|Tennessee Steinmetz]]. Hawk's numerous attempts at evicting Mrs. Steinmetz have been unsuccessful, and his workers are growing impatient. Hawk sends his lawyer nephew Willoughby Whitfield to Mrs. Steinmetz.

Mrs. Steinmetz takes a liking to Willoughby, and introduces him to [[Herbie the Love Bug|Herbie]], as well as sentient retired [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]] Old No. 22 and an unnamed sentient [[orchestrion]]. Her neighbor Nicole, who was taken in by Mrs. Steinmetz after her apartment was demolished by Hawk, punches Willoughby when she learns that he works for Hawk, but tries to make it up to him with a ride in Herbie. However, Herbie goes berserk after Willoughby insults him, taking the two to a [[Demolition derby|car version]] of a [[joust]] tournament, which Herbie wins.

Later at a restaurant on [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], Nicole shocks Willoughby by telling him all the horrible things Hawk has done. Upset, Willoughby accidentally reveals that Hawk is his uncle; an enraged Nicole hits him into the water with a lobster in response. Willoughby then reconciles with Herbie and decides to cut ties with Hawk, tries to go home in disguise, but Nicole convinces him to stay, having overheard him criticize his uncle on the phone.

Meanwhile, Hawk decides to drive Mrs. Steinmetz out himself, starting with stealing Herbie. Hawk manages to hotwire Herbie, but Herbie retaliates by causing a series of traffic collisions and discarding Hawk at his office. Later, when Herbie takes Mrs. Steinmetz to market, they are chased by Hawk's men; Herbie makes several daring escapes, with Mrs. Steinmetz oblivious throughout.

Mrs. Steinmetz suggests to Herbie that he drive Nicole and Willoughby to the beach. Willoughby and Nicole enjoy a romantic moment at the beach, but Hawk's chauffeur bribes a man to block the only road out, prompting Herbie to surf through the bay to find an alternate route.

When they return to the firehouse after dark, every item of furniture has been removed by Hawk. The group tracks the theft to Hawk's warehouse, where they break in and recover Mrs. Steinmetz's belongings, loaded into Old No. 22. On the way home, Herbie and Old No. 22 are pursued by Hawk, and Mrs. Steinmetz meets and becomes enamored with an inebriated old-timer named Judson, who resembles her late husband.

The next morning, Mrs. Steinmetz decides to confront Hawk herself. Accompanied by Willoughby, Mrs. Steinmetz drives Herbie onto the window cleaning machine of Hawk's skyscraper to reach his office, where they overhear Hawk on the phone with [[Demolition|demolition agent]] Loostgarten discussing a deal to demolish the firehouse. In response, she activates the window cleaning machine, filling the office with soap and water. Herbie chases Hawk around the office, then outside onto a ledge of the building, until Mrs. Steinmetz calms him down.

Disguising his voice to resemble his uncle's, Willoughby calls Loostgarten and misdirects him to demolish Hawk's house. Late that evening, Loostgarten telephones Hawk to confirm the demolition, waking Hawk from a nightmare; Hawk gives confirmation, but realizes too late that he has condemned his own residence, and angrily chases after Loostgarten after a portion of his house is demolished.

Hawk fakes a truce with Mrs. Steinmetz; thinking him to be sincere, Willoughby and Nicole go for dinner, while Mrs. Steinmetz invites Judson to the firehouse for a date of their own. However, Hawk arrives with heavy equipment to demolish the firehouse, prompting Herbie to search for Nicole and Willoughby. In Herbie's absence, the only means of defense is an antique [[fire hose]], which Judson uses against Hawk's men until it bursts.

With Nicole and Willoughby on board, Herbie rounds up an army of other sentient Volkswagen Beetles from around the city, who chase after Hawk and his men, taking advantage of Hawk's fear of Herbie and causing his men to flee. Hawk is arrested after nearly getting knocked down by a police car. Willoughby and Nicole get married, and ride Herbie through an arch formed by his Volkswagen Beetle friends.
