==Plot==
Escaping from [[China]] with a [[microfilm]] of the formula for the mysterious "Lotus X", Lord Edward Southmere, a [[King's Messenger]], is chased by a group of Chinese spies.

Back in [[London]], Lord Southmere runs into the Natural History Museum and hides the microfilm in the bones of a large dinosaur skeleton. The spies decide to steal the dinosaur, so they can search it properly, and load the ''Brontosaurus'' skeleton on the back of their [[Traction engine#Steam wagon|steam lorry]].  Some nannies steal the vehicle, which they drive through the foggy streets of London before being carried off to safety on a flat wagon at the back of a train.

The spies eventually find the microfilm at the museum inside the bones of another large dinosaur skeleton, and all misunderstanding is set aside, with good results for all.
