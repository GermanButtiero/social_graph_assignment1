PLOT: Kumandra, a prosperous Southeast Asian land where humans live alongside dragons, is ravaged by the Druun, mindless spirits that petrify every living being in their path. Sisu, the last surviving dragon, concentrates her magic into a gem and vanquishes the Druun, reviving Kumandra's people, but not its dragons. A power struggle for the gem divides Kumandra's people into five chiefdoms called Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail, corresponding to their placement along a gigantic dragon-shaped river.

500 years later, Chief Benja of the Heart tribe retains possession of the gem and trains his young daughter Raya, a warrior princess, to protect it. Benja, believing Kumandra can be reunited, holds a feast for all five tribes. During the feast, Raya befriends Namaari, princess of the Fang tribe, who gives Raya a dragon pendant. Raya trusts Namaari and shows her the gem's chamber, but Namaari betrays her as part of a plot to help Fang steal the gem. After being alerted to the attack, Benja and the other tribes arrive and start fighting over the gem, breaking it into five pieces. The gem's destruction creates a fissure that releases the Druun, who quickly overrun the Land of Heart. The tribe leaders each steal a piece of the gem and flee. Benja notices water repels the Druun, and throws Raya into a river to save her before being petrified, resulting in his demise.

Six years later, Raya treks across Kumandra to find Sisu, hoping she will create another gem and vanquish the Druun. In Tail, Raya summons Sisu, who reveals she did not create the gem but wielded it on behalf of her four siblings, all of whom contributed their magic to the gem. Raya and Sisu, who disguises as a human, resolve to reclaim the four pieces of the gem, reassemble it, and use it to vanquish the Druun and restore the petrified. Along the way, they meet Boun, a young restaurateur from Tail; Little Noi, an infant con artist from Talon; and Tong, a warrior from Spine; all of whom have lost loved ones to the Druun. Namaari, hoping to gain the gem shards for the Fang tribe, pursues Raya. Since each gem shard they acquire blesses Sisu with one of her siblings' magical powers, Raya, cautious of their new companions, insists Sisu remain disguised. In Spine, Sisu eventually reveals herself to save Raya from Namaari.

In Fang, Sisu persuades Raya to propose an alliance with Namaari rather than steal the final shard. As a gesture of trust, Raya returns the pendant Namaari gave her years before. Namaari, torn between her responsibility to Fang and her wish to help defeat the Druun, threatens the party with a crossbow. Sisu tries to calm Namaari down, but Raya attacks with her whip sword after seeing Namaari's finger move on the trigger, causing the crossbow to fire and kill Sisu. With Sisu dead, all of the water drains away, allowing the Druun to overrun the realm.

Enraged, Raya pursues Namaari, and the two fight while the others use the gem pieces to help the people of Fang evacuate, even while their power fades. Raya prepares to kill Namaari, but calms down when Namaari reminds her that her inability to trust others led to Sisu's death, and they go to aid the others. As the gem pieces' power begins to run out and the Druun near her group, Raya remembers how trust allowed Sisu to save the world. She urges the others to unite and reassemble the gem, showing her faith in Namaari by handing over her gem piece and allowing the Druun to petrify her. Boun, Tong, Noi, and her ongis follow suit, and Namaari reassembles the gem before also being petrified. This action unleashes a shockwave that spreads throughout Kumandra, vanquishing the Druun and conjuring up a magical rainstorm that restores the waters and revives everyone, including the dragons, who later revive Sisu. After the group reunites with their loved ones, the tribes and dragons gather at Heart to unite as Kumandra once again.
