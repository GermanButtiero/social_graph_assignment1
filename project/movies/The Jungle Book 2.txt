PLOT: Following the events of the previous film, Mowgli now resides in the "Man-Village" with Shanti, the girl who lured him into the village, having been adopted by the village leader, who has a wife named Messua and a son named Ranjan. However, wanting to return to the exciting life of the jungle, Mowgli nearly leads the other children in the village across the river, against the instruction of the village leader, who punishes Mowgli for disobeying him and putting the other children in danger by sending him to his room without dinner.

Meanwhile, in the jungle, Baloo starts to feel lonely and misses Mowgli. He goes to the Man-Village to get Mowgli, but Bagheera, alongside Colonel Hathi and his herd, tries to keep him away from there. Shere Khan has returned to Baloo and Bagheera's area of the jungle, seeking revenge on Mowgli for defeating him earlier, much to the vultures' surprise along with their new member Lucky.

Later that night Baloo gets to the Man-Village and takes Mowgli back into the jungle; unbeknownst to them, Shere Khan had also entered the village looking for Mowgli, only to be attacked by the villagers. In the ensuing chase, Shanti and Ranjan sneak into the jungle to rescue Mowgli, believing that Baloo is a rabid animal who has kidnapped him. Kaa attempts to eat Mowgli while he obliviously sings with Baloo, only to be inadvertently injured by them with prickly pears. After swearing off associating with humans again, Kaa comes across and hypnotizes Shanti, whom he tries to eat only to be hit with a stick by Ranjan and scared off a cliff.

Bagheera learns of Mowgli's escape from the village when the humans search the jungle for him (which causes many animals including Hathi and his herd to be scared) and immediately suspects Baloo. Mowgli instructs Baloo to scare off Shanti should she appear, and bemoans his boring life in the Man-Village. Baloo and Mowgli journey to King Louie's old temple (King Louie having moved out) for a party. When the jungle animals mock Shanti and other aspects of Mowgli's life in the Man-Village, Mowgli angrily leaves. He finds Shanti and Ranjan, but Baloo scares Shanti. When the truth comes out that Mowgli ordered Baloo to scare her, Shanti and Ranjan run away, abandoning Mowgli.

Baloo realizes that Mowgli misses his village life, but when Mowgli tries to reconnect with his human friends, they are cornered by Shere Khan, who chases Mowgli and Shanti to an abandoned temple built above a lake of lava. Baloo instructs Bagheera to protect Ranjan while he goes to save Mowgli and Shanti. After confusing Shere Khan by banging several different gongs, Shanti's presence is revealed to Shere Khan. Baloo tackles Shere Khan to the ground, allowing Mowgli and Shanti enough time to escape, but the tiger chases them to a statue across a pit of lava. Shere Khan is trapped within the statue's mouth, and it plummets onto a large stone in the lava below.

With Shere Khan finally thwarted, Baloo decides to let Mowgli return to the Man-Village with Shanti and Ranjan, and Bagheera proudly compliments Baloo for making a wise decision. Upon returning to the Man-Village, Mowgli reconciles with the village leader, who apologizes to Mowgli for failing to understand that the jungle was part of his identity. Mowgli embraces his new life in the Man-Village, and the children return daily to visit Baloo and Bagheera in the jungle.
