PLOT: Long ago, in a world inhabited by mythical creatures, magic was commonplace, although it was difficult to master. As technology progressed over the centuries, magic became obsolete and eventually fell out of use.

In the modern day, Ian Lightfoot is a teenage elf struggling with self-confidence; his older brother Barley is an enthusiastic and impulsive role-playing gamer. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian's birth, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, centaur police officer Colt Bronco, whom the brothers dislike. On Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the boys a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare Phoenix gem, and a letter describing a "visitation spell" that can resurrect Wilden for one day. Ian succeeds in casting the spell but is interrupted by Barley before completing it; consequently, only the lower half of Wilden's body reforms before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and finish the spell before sunset, taking Barley's beloved van "Guinevere". Laurel discovers the boys have gone missing and sets out after them.

Seeking a map to the gem, the brothers visit the Manticore's Tavern with Wilden in tow. The tavern, once a gathering place for would-be adventurers, is now a family restaurant managed by the Manticore ("Corey"). During an argument with Ian over the map, Corey realizes how mundane her life has become and drives out her customers in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the map and the restaurant. The only remaining clue to the gem's location is a children's menu suggesting Raven's Point, a nearby mountain. Soon after the boys leave, Laurel arrives and befriends Corey; Corey warns her that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which the women steal from a pawn shop.

Ian, Barley, and Wilden travel to the mountains, narrowly escaping encounters with the police and a motorcycle gang of sprites. Officer Bronco catches up to the group and orders them to return home; Ian appears to comply but unexpectedly drives away, leading to a wild police chase. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. "Raven's Point" is revealed to be a series of raven statues leading down into a cave. While exploring, Barley confesses that he was too afraid to say goodbye to Wilden on his deathbed. The party make their way through the cave, evading a series of increasingly dangerous traps, and emerge on the other side, only to find themselves back in town in front of Ian's high school. Believing their quest has been in vain, Ian lashes out at Barley and calls him a screw-up before leaving with Wilden.

As the sun begins to set, Ian sadly reviews his list of things he always wanted to do with his father and realizes that Barley has been a father figure to him throughout his life. Meanwhile, Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unknowingly triggering the curse. Pieces of the high school and other nearby objects combine to form a dragon-shaped golem, intent on retrieving the gem. Corey flies in with Laurel, who drives the magic sword into the dragon's heart, giving Ian enough time to recast the visitation spell. As Wilden's upper body regenerates, Barley volunteers to distract the dragon so Ian can meet their father. Instead, Ian sends Barley ahead, acknowledging the role his brother played in his upbringing. With help from Laurel, Ian manages to fight off the dragon and destroy it, granting Barley the opportunity to find closure with their father. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.

Some time later, Ian’s confidence and spell-casting abilities have improved. As the world begins to rediscover magic, Ian and Barley set off on a new quest together.
