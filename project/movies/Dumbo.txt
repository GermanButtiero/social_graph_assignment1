==Plot==
<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. This article is currently at 546.-->

In [[Florida]], while a large [[circus]] spends the off-season in its winter grounds, a [[White stork#Storks and delivery of babies|flock of white storks delivers many babies to the animals]]. One [[Indian elephant|elephant]], Mrs. Jumbo, does not receive her baby, and keeps scanning the sky in hope. The next spring, the circus sets out on a new tour. A belated stork catches up with a moving [[Circus train|train]] named Casey Jr. and drops off the expected baby elephant, Jumbo Jr. The other elephants are initially delighted, until they see the baby has revealed far-oversized ears, and mockingly nickname him "Dumbo". Mrs. Jumbo shows her baby great care and love, defending him from the others' abuse.

Being clumsy due to his ears, Dumbo is made into a [[sideshow]] attraction. When some rowdy boys start to bully Dumbo and his ears, even breaking into his [[Pen (enclosure)|pen]], the furious Mrs. Jumbo [[Spanking|spanks]] their leader. The circus staff is drawn in by the commotion and sees Mrs. Jumbo throwing hay bales at spectator, the shocked staff remove Dumbo from the pen, causing Mrs. Jumbo to be further enraged, eventually dousing the circus’s [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] in a water tub. She is subsequently deemed mad and locked up in a cage, while Dumbo is blamed for the incident by the elephants, and is still bullied by the others.

After scaring off the other elephants, Timothy, a mouse that travels with the circus, befriends Dumbo and decides to make him a star. He whispers in the ringmaster's ear while the latter sleeps, convincing him to try a new stunt with Dumbo as the top of a pyramid of elephants. Dumbo trips on his ears during the show and knocks over the pyramid, injuring the others and causing the [[wikt:big top|big top]] to collapse. After, all elephants exile Dumbo permanently as he is put in with the clowns' firemen act, regularly jumping from a "burning building" prop into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity, he hates the new performance and is upset.

Timothy decides to take Dumbo to see Mrs. Jumbo, but they cannot see each other's faces and can only intertwine trunks. Meanwhile, the clowns decide to increase the popularity of their fireman act by dangerously raising the platform Dumbo jumps from. In celebration of the plan, they drink [[champagne]], and a bottle of it falls into a water vat. Crying after visiting his mother, Dumbo has an unsettling case of the [[hiccups]], so Timothy takes him to the vat for some water, only to discover that the water contains champagne. Both of them get drunk, and [[Seeing pink elephants|hallucinate pink elephants]].

While recovering the next morning, Dumbo and Timothy are later discovered asleep high up in a tree by [[Jim Crow (character)|Jim Crow]]  and his gang of [[American crow|crows]]. Initially making fun of Timothy's assertion that Dumbo flew with his ears while being drunk, the crows are soon moved by Dumbo's sad story. They decide to help Timothy, giving him a "magic [[Flight feather#Rectrices|feather]]" to help Dumbo fly. Holding the feather, Dumbo does indeed take off a second time. He and Timothy return to the circus with plans to surprise the audience.

During the clowns' fire act, Dumbo jumps off the platform and prepares to fly. He drops the feather, but Timothy assures him it was only a psychological aid. As Dumbo successfully flies about the big top, much to the audience’s delight, he throws a trunkful of peanuts to the other elephants as payback. Dumbo gains fame and fortune, Timothy becomes his new manager and signs him to a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] contract, and Mrs. Jumbo is freed. She and Dumbo are given a private coach on Casey Jr., and the crows wave goodbye to the duo as they travel away.
