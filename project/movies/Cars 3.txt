Five years after competing in the World Grand Prix,{{Efn|As depicted in ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011)}} [[Lightning McQueen]], now a seven-time Piston Cup champion,<ref name=":1">{{#invoke:cite|web|title=Pixar Animation Studios |url=https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/cars-3 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220811210634/https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/cars-3 |archive-date=August 11, 2022 |access-date=September 9, 2022 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> finds himself overshadowed by [[List of Cars characters#Jackson Storm|Jackson Storm]], a rookie who is the first among a new generation of race cars with advanced technology to enhance speed and performance. As Storm wins throughout the season, many racing veterans retire or are replaced by younger racers. In the final race at Los Angeles, Lightning briefly leads but falls behind after being overtaken by Storm and the other next-gen cars. He struggles to keep up, loses control, and crashes after hitting the wall, prematurely ending his worst season on record.

Four months later, Lightning, who has since recovered from his crash, decides that he will continue racing and calls his sponsors, Rusty and Dusty, who reveal they have sold Rust-eze to a wealthy business car named [[List of Cars characters#Sterling|Sterling]]. Sterling assigns Lightning to train at the Rust-eze Racing Center under [[List of Cars characters#Cruz Ramirez|Cruz Ramirez]], where he struggles to adapt to the modern training methods. After Lightning accidentally damages a simulator, Sterling tries to force him to retire. Adamant that he can still race, Lightning offers that if he wins the upcoming Florida 500, he can decide if he wants to keep racing; otherwise, he will retire immediately. Sterling reluctantly accepts the deal, but on the condition that Cruz must go with him.

Cruz's unconventional training methods and lack of real-world racing experience frustrate Lightning as they attempt to record his top speed at Fireball Beach. When Lightning decides to train at the Thunder Hollow Speedway, they realize it is being used for a [[Figure 8 racing|figure-8 style]] [[demolition derby]] called the "Crazy Eight" and are forced to participate, in which Cruz wins and accidentally reveals him to the public. Lightning angrily yells at Cruz after the demolition derby and accidentally breaks her trophy. Cruz reveals that she had always wanted to be a racer but was never confident enough to enter a race, so she resigns as Lightning's trainer and heads back to the racing center. Ashamed and without other options, Lightning calls his friend [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]] for advice, who suggests that Lightning track down [[Doc Hudson]]'s mentor and crew chief Smokey in his hometown of [[Thomasville, Georgia]]. 

Hence, Lightning catches up to Cruz and convinces her to rejoin him. In Thomasville, they meet up with Smokey, who reveals that, even though Doc never raced again, he found new happiness in training Lightning.{{Efn|As depicted in ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006)}} After Lightning accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and Doc's old friends, Louise "Barnstormer" Nash, River Scott, and Junior "Midnight" Moon, help him learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage, using Cruz as his [[sparring partner]]. After many attempts, Lightning finally manages to pass Cruz during the final practice race. However, Cruz suddenly overtakes Lightning, which causes him to remember being passed by Storm before his crash, shaking his confidence.

At the Florida 500, Lightning starts at the back but moves up the ranks with Smokey's help. Sterling doubts Lightning's capability and orders Cruz back to the training center, despite her desire to stay. Hearing them on his radio and recalling Cruz's racing dream, Lightning sidesteps a huge pile-up and has his crew prep Cruz to race in his place, giving her a chance to succeed. Though initially hesitant, Cruz starts overtaking cars with Lightning's coaching. She ends up behind Storm, who threatens her by ramming her against the wall on the final lap. Using an old move from Doc Hudson, Cruz flips over Storm, overtakes him, and wins the race.

As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer from Dinoco's owner [[List of Cars characters#Tex Dinoco|Tex Dinoco]]. Since Lightning and Cruz were both wearing #95, Lightning becomes the joint-winner of the race and effectively passes his deal with Sterling. Returning to [[Radiator Springs]], Lightning reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling. Now decked in Doc's old racing colors, Lightning decides to continue racing but trains Cruz first for the rest of the season.
