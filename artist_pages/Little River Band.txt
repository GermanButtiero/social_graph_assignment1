==History==
===1970–1974: Pre Little River Band===
{{main|Mississippi (band){{!}}Mississippi}}
Little River Band formed in March 1975 in Melbourne as a [[soft rock|harmony rock]] group with [[Beeb Birtles]] on guitar and vocals, [[Graham Davidge]] on lead guitar, [[Graeham Goble]] on guitar and vocals, [[Dave Orams]] on bass guitar, [[Derek Pellicci]] on drums and [[Glenn Shorrock]] on lead vocals.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Upon formation they were an Australian [[supergroup (music)|super group]], with Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock each from prominent local bands.<ref name="Nostalgia Bio"/> Birtles had been the bass guitarist and vocalist in the pop-rock band [[Zoot (band)|Zoot]] (which launched the career of singer-guitarist [[Rick Springfield]]) from 1967 to 1971.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

Goble had led [[Adelaide]]-formed folk rock group Allison Gros in 1970. They relocated to Melbourne and in 1972 were renamed as [[Mississippi (band)|Mississippi]], a harmony [[country rock]] band, where late that year Birtles joined on guitar and vocals and Pellicci on drums. They had chart success in Australia and built up a following on the concert and festival circuit. During 1971 to 1972 the original members of Mississippi had also recorded as a [[studio band]] under the pseudonym Drummond.<ref name="Kimball D"/> They achieved a number-one hit, for eight consecutive weeks, on the ''[[Go-Set]]'' National Top&nbsp;40 with a novelty cover version of the Rays' song "[[Daddy Cool (The Rays song)|Daddy Cool]]".<ref name="Go-Set Charts Sep 71"/>

Shorrock had been the lead singer of a pop band, [[The Twilights (band)|the Twilights]] (1964–69), and a country rock group, [[Axiom (Australian band)|Axiom]], from 1969 to 1971 (alongside singer-songwriter [[Brian Cadd]]).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Both Axiom and Mississippi had relocated to the United Kingdom to try to break into the local record market, but without success.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Axiom disbanded after moving to the UK, and Shorrock sang for a more progressive rock outfit, [[Esperanto (progressive rock band)|Esperanto]], in 1973.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> He also provided backing vocals for [[Cliff Richard]].<ref name="Thompson"/>

In late 1974, Birtles, Goble and Pellicci met with talent manager [[Glenn Wheatley]] (former bass player of [[the Masters Apprentices]]) in London, with a view to forming a new band.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> After auditioning [[Peter Doyle (singer)|Peter Doyle]] as lead singer, they settled on Shorrock.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MILESAGO - Groups & Solo Artists - Peter Doyle |url=http://www.milesago.com/artists/peterdoyle.htm |access-date=14 October 2022 |website=www.milesago.com}}</ref> With Wheatley as manager, Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock agreed to reconvene in Melbourne in early 1975.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Due to the indifferent reception they had each received in the UK, they decided their new band would establish itself in the United States.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Wheatley's first-hand experiences of the rip-offs in the 1960s music scene, combined with working in music management in the UK and the US in the early 1970s, allowed him to help the Little River Band become the first Australian group to enjoy consistent commercial and chart success in the US.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/><ref name="O'Connor"/>

[[File:Little_River_sign.jpg|thumb|A road sign to [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]], on a trip by the fledgling band from Melbourne to [[Geelong]], inspired Glenn Shorrock to suggest the band name]]
After their return to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig at Martini's Hotel in [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]].<ref name="graehamgoble.com"/> In Birtles' autobiography, ''Every Day of My Life'', he explains how the band came to change its name:
{{Blockquote
|text=[Shorrock] and I were sitting in the back seat of a car driving down Princes Highway to play a gig at The Golf View Hotel in Geelong. As we passed the [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] exit sign, [Shorrock] said "Little River, that'd be a good song title." Within a split second he said, "Hey, what about Little River Band?" We all agreed it was the perfect name for us.<ref name="Birtles Every"/>

Little River Band (as Mississippi) had recorded their first track, a cover version of [[the Everly Brothers]]' song "[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]", in February 1975,<ref name="McFarlane"/> at [[Armstrong Studios]]. However, [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s version appeared in the following month, so LRB did not release theirs.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Before the group performed, Graham Davidge was replaced by [[Ric Formosa]] on guitar, and Dave Orams by [[Roger McLachlan]] on bass guitar and backing vocals (ex-[[Levi Smith's Clefs#Afterwards|Levi Smith's Clefs]]).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Wheatley"/> [[Phil Manning (musician)|Phil Manning]] (ex-[[Chain (band)|Chain]]) was LRB's first choice for lead guitar. Manning was busy with his solo career and recommended Formosa. The latter had travelled to Australia from Canada and was working in a music store; he joined soon after.<ref name="AutoIM-1"/>

===1975–1976: early years===
In May 1975 they signed with [[EMI Records]] and started recording their debut [[Little River Band (album)|self-titled album]] at Armstrong Studios in the following month.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1975/CB-1975-07-12.pdf|title=EMI Signs Aussie Group |magazine=[[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]]|via=World Radio History|page=42|date=12 July 1975|access-date=15 November 2021}}</ref> The album was co-produced by Birtles, Goble, Shorrock and Wheatley.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Tony Catterall of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' described it in November as "one of those flawed creations that inevitably draws a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger response."<ref name="Catterall"/> Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]] observed, "[it's] an astonishingly strong debut album."<ref name="Eder AMG"/> ''[[Little River Band (album)|Little River Band]]'' peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart<ref name="Kent"/> and was certified gold in early 1976.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1976-04-03.pdf|title=11 Capitol Records for April |magazine=[[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]]|via=World Radio History|page=34|date=3 April 1976|access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref> Their debut single, "[[Curiosity (Killed the Cat)]]", was released in September, reaching No.&nbsp;15 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart.<ref name="Kent"/> Two more singles followed, "[[Emma (Little River Band song)|Emma]]" and "[[It's a Long Way There]]".<ref name="Kent"/>

Wheatley travelled to Los Angeles in December 1975 and touted the group to various record companies until [[Rupert Perry]] of [[Capitol Records]] signed them on Christmas Eve.<ref name="Wheatley"/> Little River Band issued their second Australian album, ''[[After Hours (Little River Band album)|After Hours]]'', in April 1976. It was produced by the band but was not issued in the US until 1980.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> ''After Hours'' peaked at No.&nbsp;5 and provided the single "[[Everyday of My Life (Little River Band song)|Everyday of My Life]]", in May 1976, which reached the top&nbsp;30.<ref name="Kent"/>

===1976–1982: success and changes of personnel===
During August 1976 both Formosa and McLachlan were replaced. [[David Briggs (Australian musician)|David Briggs]] joined on guitar (ex-Cycle, the Avengers, Ram Band) and George McArdle on bass guitar (also ex-Ram Band).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="somethingelsereviews.com"/> According to Wheatley, Formosa was not enthusiastic about touring outside of Australia<ref name="Wheatley"/> and left to work as a session musician, composer and arranger. The group had also decided to bring in McArdle to replace McLachlan, who also became a sessions player and joined the country rock group [[Stars (Australian band)|Stars]] in 1976.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Mantague"/> Australian music journalist [[Ed Nimmervoll]] listed the classic line-up of the band as Birtles, Briggs, Goble, McArdle, Pellicci and Shorrock.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Formosa still worked with LRB by arranging and writing string parts for several tracks on subsequent albums.<ref name="AMG Formosa"/>

Encouraged by their Australian success, they undertook their first international tour.<ref name="McFarlane"/> They flew to the UK in September 1976 to play a show in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] supporting [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. They then opened shows in the rest of Europe for [[the Hollies]] during September and October.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Birtles advised fellow Australian bands to establish themselves in Australia first before trying the UK market.<ref name="Screaming"/> In October they performed their first US concert, at [[James Madison University]] (then called Madison College) in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]], as the opening act for [[Average White Band]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Due to US appearances and support from FM stations, "It's a Long Way There" reached No.&nbsp;28 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="somethingelsereviews.com"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/>

Little River Band's second album, ''After Hours'', had been passed over in the US by Capitol. The label selected tracks from it and from their third Australian release, ''[[Diamantina Cocktail]]'' (April 1977), to create Capitol's second US album, also titled ''Diamantina Cocktail'' (May 1977).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> The Australian version was co-produced by the group with [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] – who stayed on to co-produce their next two studio albums.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Due to tension between band members, Birtles, Goble and Shorrock recorded as much of their parts individually as was feasible.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

''The Canberra Times''{{'}} Julie Meldrum caught their local performance in May 1977 and described the band as "tightly disciplined" and "there was nothing that was not world class".<ref name="Meldrum"/> She reviewed the album, which had no Australian references and felt they were aiming at the US West Coast scene with influences from [[David Crosby]], [[Graham Nash]] and [[Little Feat]] apparent.<ref name="Meldrum 2"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic commented on the US release, "laidback, sweet country-rock, [it] has a similar sound to the band's debut, but the melodies are a little sharper and catchier, making [it] a better, more fully-rounded collection".<ref name="Erlewine"/>

In Australia, ''Diamantina Cocktail'' became their highest charting album, peaking at No.&nbsp;2;<ref name="Kent"/> while the US version reached the top&nbsp;50 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/> In January 1978 it was certified gold by [[RIAA]] for sales of 500,000 copies: the first Australian band to do so.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="RIAA Cert"/> The lead single, "[[Help Is on Its Way]]" reached [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1970s#1977|No.&nbsp;1 in Australia]].<ref name="Kent"/> Both it and the fourth single, "[[Happy Anniversary (Little River Band song)|Happy Anniversary]]", peaked in the top&nbsp;20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/>

During 1977 they consistently toured, mostly in the US, headlining in smaller venues and appearing in stadiums on multi-billed shows supporting [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Supertramp]] and [[America (band)|America]].<ref name="McFarlane"/> In August they co-headlined day two of the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Music Festival]] in the UK alongside [[Thin Lizzy]].<ref name="Reading"/> In November they supported [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Santana (band)|Santana]] at Rockarena concerts in Sydney and Melbourne.<ref name="Jands"/>

Early in 1978, Little River Band performed a free concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House, drawing 80,000 people and topping the previous record of 57,000 set by Fleetwood Mac and Little River Band on their previous Australian tour.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1978/CB-1978-02-25.pdf|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=World Radio History|title=Cashbox Magazine|page=28|date=25 February 1978|access-date=12 November 2021}}</ref>

Their fourth studio album, ''[[Sleeper Catcher]]'', was released in May 1978 and peaked at No.&nbsp;4 in Australia and No.&nbsp;16 in the US.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/> By May of the following year, it was certified platinum by RIAA for sales of 1,000,000 copies: the first Australian-recorded album to achieve that feat.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/><ref name="RIAA Cert"/> ''AllMusic'''s Mike DeGagne praised Shorrock's vocals, which give it "the perfect MOR sound, draping the tracks with his cool, breezy style that is much more apparent and effectual here than on the band's earlier efforts."<ref name="DeGagne"/> ''Sleeper Catcher'' provided three singles, with "[[Shut Down Turn Off]]" being the highest charting in Australia at No.&nbsp;16.<ref name="Kent"/> However in the US the highest charting was "[[Reminiscing]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/> The album's last single, "[[Lady (Little River Band song)|Lady]]", reached No.&nbsp;10 in the US in early 1979.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/>

Pellicci was hospitalised in May 1978 with severe burns due to [[Denatured alcohol|methylated spirits]] igniting on a barbecue.<ref name="NLA Pellicci"/> [[Geoff Cox]] (ex-Brian Cadd, [[Bootleg Family Band]], Avalanche) substituted on drums, rather than cancelling their next US tour.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="NLA Pellicci"/> They supported [[Boz Scaggs]], [[Jimmy Buffett]] and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="NLA Pellicci"/> Cox remained playing alongside Pellicci when he joined the tour in August 1978; they supported the Eagles at [[C.N.E. Stadium]] in [[Toronto]]. Cox left once Pellicci had recovered.

Keyboardist Ian Mason, who was a session player on LRB's first three albums, played as a guest on some dates of their 1978 Australian tour.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shorrock |first1=Glenn |title=Now, Where Was I? |publisher=New Holland |date=19 June 2018 |orig-year=1st pub. 2018 |page=164 |isbn=978-1-921-02473-3}}</ref> Mal Logan (ex-[[the Dingoes]], [[Renée Geyer|Renée Geyer Band]]) joined on keyboards for another US tour which commenced in late December 1978.

Nimmervoll observed that by February 1978, "frictions inside the band continued to brew, relieved a little by" side projects.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> [[Birtles & Goble]] showcased tracks rejected for LRB.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> They issued three singles, "Lonely Lives" (March 1978), "I'm Coming Home" (March 1979) and "How I Feel Tonight" (June 1980) and an album, ''The Last Romance'' (May 1980).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> "I'm Coming Home" reached No.&nbsp;8 in Australia.<ref name="Kent"/> Shorrock's solo single was a cover version of Bobby Darin's "[[Dream Lover]]" (April 1979), which peaked in the Australian top&nbsp;10.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Kent"/><ref name="iTunes Shorrock"/>

Little River Band's fifth studio album, ''[[First Under the Wire]]'', was released in July 1979. It reached No.&nbsp;2 in Australia, equalling ''Diamantina Cocktail''.<ref name="Kent"/> It was also their highest charting album on the ''Billboard'' 200 at No.&nbsp;10.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/> In November it was certified by RIAA as a platinum album.<ref name="RIAA Cert"/> ''AllMusic'''s Mark Allan described their "mix of harmony-drenched pop tunes and unthreatening rockers" which had a wide appeal.<ref name="Allan"/> Both singles, "[[Lonesome Loser]]" and "[[Cool Change (song)|Cool Change]]" peaked in the US top&nbsp;10.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/> Briggs wrote "Lonesome Loser" and Shorrock wrote "Cool Change".<ref name="APRA Cool"/>

Bassist George McArdle left in late January 1979 to become a [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]].<ref name="Austin"/> In July that year Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain, Renée Geyer Band) took over on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Fricke"/> He was replaced, in turn, by American [[Wayne Nelson]] (ex-[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina Band]]) in April 1980.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

''Backstage Pass'' was the first [[live album]] released by the band.

Goble was the producer for Australian pop singer [[John Farnham]]'s solo album, ''[[Uncovered (John Farnham album)|Uncovered]]'', which was released in September 1980.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Goble wrote or co-wrote nine of its ten tracks and provided vocals. The album had other LRB alumni: Briggs, Formosa, Logan, Nelson, Pellicci and Sullivan.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane JF"/> Farnham had signed with Wheatley's management company.<ref name="Nimmervoll JF"/>

The line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Nelson, Pellicci and Shorrock recorded Little River Band's sixth studio album,<ref name="NLA Time"/> ''[[Time Exposure (Little River Band album)|Time Exposure]]'', which was released in August 1981, with [[George Martin]] (the Beatles) producing.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> ''The Canberra Times''{{'}} Garry Raffaele felt "it's easy listening, no demands, easing up, slowing down, getting older."<ref name="Raffaele"/> By the time it appeared, [[Stephen Housden]] (ex-[[Stevie Wright (Australian singer)|Stevie Wright Band]], the Imports) replaced Briggs on lead guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> The album reached No&nbsp;.9 in Australia and No.&nbsp;21 in the US;<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/> and in November it was certified gold by RIAA.<ref name="RIAA Cert"/>

In August 1981, Nelson provided lead vocals for its lead single, "[[The Night Owls (song)|The Night Owls]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;18 in Australia and No.&nbsp;6 in the US.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/> Raffaele described the track as "the punchiest thing LRB has done for some time but it's still middle-of-the-road pap, hummable".<ref name="Raffaele"/> Nelson also shared vocals with Shorrock on the second single, "[[Take It Easy on Me]]" (November 1981).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/><ref name="chuckthewriter.com"/> According to Nimmervoll, Nelson's presence added to the conflict between band members and that Goble "agitated within the band to replace [Shorrock] with [Farnham]".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

===1982–1986: John Farnham years===
In February 1982, Shorrock left Little River Band and resumed his solo career.<ref name="chuckthewriter.com" /> Farnham replaced Shorrock on lead vocals<ref name="Moore"/> and "[[Man on Your Mind]]", the third single from ''Time Exposure'' (with Shorrock's vocals), reached No.&nbsp;14 in the US.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/> Birtles described the removal of Briggs and Shorrock:
<blockquote>I remember a couple of embarrassing moments in the studio where [Briggs] was quite rude to [Martin], insisting that his way was better and that he didn't need to be told how or what to play. After our return from recording in Montserrat, during a meeting at [Wheatley]'s house, [Goble] was quite vocal about [Briggs'] conduct. He confronted [him] and virtually fired him ... After [Shorrock] took his frustration out on me one day during a rehearsal ... I said I couldn't work with [him] any more. [Goble], who had always been at opposite poles to Shorrock, agreed with me and Wheatley started freaking out saying he thought it was a big mistake ... in hindsight, I believe he was right on the money and to me this would be the mistake that cut Little River Band's throat.<ref name="Birtles Every"/>{{rp|179, 185, 189–90}}</blockquote>

In September 1982, Farnham told Susan Moore of ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]'' how easy it was to fit into the group although both recording and stage work had differed.<ref name="Moore"/> On covering early LRB repertoire he said, "We've had to change the key with a lot of things because Glenn sang in a different register from me."<ref name="Moore"/> The first single with Farnham as lead vocalist, "[[The Other Guy (Little River Band song)|The Other Guy]]", was released in November 1982 and reached No.&nbsp;18 in Australia and No.&nbsp;11 in the US.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/> Another single, "[[Down on the Border]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;7 in Australia.<ref name="Kent"/>

Their next single, "We Two", from their seventh studio album, ''[[The Net (album)|The Net]]'', reached No.&nbsp;22 in the US.<ref name="Billboard Charts"/> It had been co-produced by the group and Ern Rose (Mississippi, Rénee Geyer, Stars).<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="AMG Rose"/> DeGagne reviewed the album, which "failed to capture the same success they experienced with Shorrock at the helm. The same type of soft rock fluidity and laid-back charm has been replaced with a sound that seems forced and somewhat strained".<ref name="DeGagne 2"/> In 1983, "You're Driving Me Out of My Mind" became the group's last single to reach the US Top&nbsp;40.<ref name="DeGagne 2"/> The band moved towards a 1980s style of sound and added a keyboardist, [[David Hirschfelder]] (ex-[[Stylus (band)|Peter Cupples Band]], who had guested on ''The Net'' and at some LRB shows), in September 1983.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

The pressures of success and constant touring took their toll on the band as line-up changes continued. Birtles left in October 1983 because he did not like the harder, more progressive musical path which Goble was taking and because he had preferred Shorrock's vocals.<ref name="chuckthewriter.com"/> Birtles contributed to soundtracks for the feature films ''From Something Great'' (1985) and ''[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (film)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]'' (1988).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> He also worked as a session musician, eventually relocating to the US and releasing a solo album, ''Driven by Dreams'', in 2000.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="AMG Birtles"/> Pellicci left in February 1984 for similar reasons and [[Steve Prestwich]] (ex-[[Cold Chisel]]) replaced him on drums.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Pellicci also became a session musician: including working for Brian Cadd.<ref name="Holmgren"/>

Their eighth studio album, ''[[Playing to Win (Little River Band album)|Playing to Win]]'', was released in January 1985, which delivered a harder sound with producer [[Spencer Proffer]].<ref name="Holmgren"/> The change in sound, along with the unofficial shortening of their name to LRB, confused fans and radio programmers. Australian musicologist [[Ian McFarlane]] felt it was "a strong album but it failed to halt the band's slide in popularity."<ref name="McFarlane"/> It reached No.&nbsp;38 in Australia and No.&nbsp;75 on the US charts.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/> The title track made No.&nbsp;59 on the Australian singles chart, No.&nbsp;15 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;60 on Hot&nbsp;100.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/><ref name="Billboard Playing"/> The second single, "Blind Eyes", failed to enter the charts.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Billboard Charts"/>

In July 1985, LRB performed on the [[Oz for Africa]] benefit concert (part of the global [[Live Aid]] program): "Don't Blame Me", "Full Circle", "Night Owls", and "Playing to Win". They were broadcast in Australia (on both [[Seven Network]] and [[Nine Network]]) and on [[MTV]] in the US. In the US the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network broadcast "Don't Blame Me" and "Night Owls" during their Live Aid telecast ("Night Owls" was only partially transmitted).<ref name="OzAfrica"/> Farnham left the group following the completion of their short Australian tour in April 1986, which had Malcolm Wakeford drumming in Prestwich's place.<ref name="graehamgoble.com"/> Their ninth studio album, ''[[No Reins]]'', recorded when Farnham was still aboard, appeared in the next month and was produced by Richard Dodd.<ref name="Holmgren"/> It reached the Kent Music Report top&nbsp;100.<ref name="Kent"/>

Farnham explained to Pollyanna Sutton of ''The Canberra Times'' why he left, "[On the stage] I was up front and had to be the most liked. There was a lot of pressure because it wasn't, perhaps, working as it should, although there were other contributing things like the membership changes and perhaps the material."<ref name="Sutton"/> Nimmervoll described the Farnham years, "The experiment had never worked. Whatever [Farnham]'s talents, America longed for [Shorrock]. At the end of 1985, while LRB was seriously contemplating its future, Farnham took the initiative to start work on another solo album."<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Farnham continued to be managed by Wheatley – who left LRB in 1987 – and his solo career took off with his next album, ''[[Whispering Jack]]'' (October 1986).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Hirschfelder, McLachlan, Nelson and Pellicci contributed to the album or the related tour.<ref name="Holmgren"/>

===1987–1998: Shorrock's return===
After Farnham's departure, Little River Band were in limbo until July 1987 when Pellicci and Shorrock returned at the request of [[Irving Azoff]], the head of [[MCA Records]], who wanted the band on his label.<ref name="Wardlaw 2"/> The reformed group signed new management with Geoffrey Schuhkraft and Paul Palmer, who assisted the line-up of Goble, Housden, Nelson, Pellicci and Shorrock in establishing a holding company, We Two Pty. Ltd, with all members as directors in equal share.<ref name="chuckthewriter.com"/><ref name="Quinn"/> Former manager Glenn Wheatley signed away rights to the band's name to the new company on 12 May 1988.<ref>{{Citation |title=Graeham Goble On Losing the Little River Band Name | date=3 March 2021 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9i__i-4hAI |access-date=19 May 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Federal"/><ref>{{Citation | title=Assignment Abstract of Title Information | url=https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73139303&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch}}</ref>

In July 1988, Pellicci described the group's previous two albums: "It was an overstatement to say the response to ''No Reins'' and ''Playing to Win'' was lukewarm — there was no response at all."<ref name="Lynch"/> The revamped group with keyboardist James Roche<ref name="Roche"/> (Jamie Paddle)<ref name="APRA Buses"/> performed at the opening of [[World Expo 88]] in [[Brisbane]] on 30 April. They were joined by the Eagles' [[Glenn Frey]], who also accompanied them that year on tour.<ref name="Kruger Frey"/>

The group released their tenth studio album, ''[[Monsoon (Little River Band album)|Monsoon]]'', in May 1988, which peaked at No.&nbsp;9 on the Kent Music Report.<ref name="Kent"/> It was co-produced by Boylan and Goble.<ref name="Holmgren"/> ''The Canberra Times''{{'}} Lisa Wallace was disappointed by its lack of innovation despite showing technical skills.<ref name="Wallace"/> Its lead single, "Love Is a Bridge", co-written by Goble and Housden was released in April and peaked at No.&nbsp;7 on the Kent Music Report.<ref name="Kent"/> It was their second highest charting single in the Australian market,<ref name="McFarlane"/> and a moderate Adult Contemporary radio hit in the US.

In 1989 the group recorded "Listen to Your Heart", written by [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]] and [[Billy Steinberg]], for the film soundtrack of ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The eleventh studio album, ''[[Get Lucky (Little River Band album)|Get Lucky]]'', was released in April 1990. It was their last charting album in Australia and made the top&nbsp;60.<ref name="AUS Charts"/> Mike Boehm of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' caught their gig in May, where "[Shorrock] was stiff and seemed stuck for words between songs. But he knew what to do when the music started, singing in a comfortably husky voice that resembled Phil Collins in tone and easy pop appeal. [Nelson], the group's Californian, generated more heat in his two lead vocal turns. The three-part harmonies behind Shorrock were exemplary, although the Crosby, Stills & Nash parallels were unmistakable. Lead guitarist [Housden] reinforced the emphasis on melody with his clean, lyrical lines."<ref name="Boehm"/>

MCA released a compilation album, ''[[Worldwide Love]]'', of tracks from the previous two albums on their [[Curb Records]] imprint in June 1991. Both ''Get Lucky'' and ''Worldwide Love'' peaked in the top&nbsp;40 on the [[Swiss Hitparade]];<ref name="SWI Charts"/> with the latter also appearing on the [[Ö3 Austria Top 40]].<ref name="AUT Charts"/> Goble had ceased touring with the group in 1989 and left altogether by 1992,<ref name="McFarlane"/> as well as resigning from We Two.<ref name="Elder"/> [[Peter Beckett]] (ex-[[Player (band)|Player]]) joined in 1989 to take Goble's place. The group went through a series of keyboard players, including [[Tony Sciuto]] (1990–1992, 1993–1997) and Richard Bryant (1992–1993, ex-[[the Doobie Brothers]]).<ref name="Holmgren"/>

In September 1992, Nelson's daughter was killed in a traffic collision in San Diego while he was on tour with the band in Europe.<ref name="Zamichow"/> Nelson immediately returned home and Hal Tupaea substituted on bass guitar for the New Zealand dates of the band's tour in November 1993.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="peterbeckett-player.com"/><ref name="Shorrock book"/>{{rp|200–201}} Little River Band subsequently took a break until Nelson's return in 1994 and embarked on a four-and-a-half month 20th anniversary US tour in 1995.<ref name="Shorrock book"/>{{rp|211–212}}<ref name="peterbeckett-player.com"/>

Shorrock left again in 1996: he was offered the option to buy out the remaining members of We Two Pty. Ltd.<ref name="Perkins"/> He took a one-third share of the monetary value of the company as he did not want to commit to the band's US touring schedule. Shorrock was replaced on lead vocals by Melbourne singer [[Steve Wade (singer)|Steve Wade]] (ex-Dolphin Street).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Nelson also left in 1996 and Tupaea returned on bass guitar.<ref name="Holmgren"/> This line-up lasted until late 1997, when everyone, except Housden and Wade, started to leave, including Pellicci, who left again that December.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> The departure of all original directors left Housden as the sole owner of We Two Pty Ltd and the Little River Band's name and trademarks.<ref name="Quinn"/><ref name="Elder"/><ref name="Perkins"/>

===1998–present===
{{main|We Two Pty Ltd v Shorrock (2002)}}
[[File:LittleRiverBandOct06.jpg|thumb|250px|LRB performing at the [[Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood]] in October 2006]]
In 1998, Housden established a new band configuration with contracted members: Wade was joined by [[Paul Gildea]] on vocals and guitars; Kevin Murphy on vocals, drums and percussion; Adrian Scott on vocals and keyboards (ex-[[Air Supply]]) and McLachlan, who returned after 22 years, on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> McLachlan's second tenure was short lived; both he and Scott departed after a year. Nelson returned early in the following year and Glenn Reither joined on keyboards, saxophone and backing vocals. Gildea and Wade left early in 2000 with Australian Greg Hind joining on vocals and guitars and Nelson taking over as lead singer. The line-up of Hind, Housden, Murphy, Nelson and Reither recorded two studio albums, ''Where We Started From'' (November 2000) and ''Test of Time'' (June 2004).

In March 2002, [[Birtles Shorrock Goble]] (BSG) were formed in Melbourne as a soft rock trio, initially billed as "The Original Little River Band" or "The Voices of Little River Band". Wheatley returned as their manager. They undertook a series of concerts performing LRB's earlier material.<ref name="Elder"/><ref name="Kruger BSG"/> In June of that year a legal dispute, ''[[We Two Pty Ltd v Shorrock (2002)]]'', over the use of the name "Little River Band" reached the [[Federal Court of Australia]].<ref name="Federal"/> Housden's company, We Two Pty Ltd, lodged an action against Birtles, Goble and Shorrock seeking to stop BSG from using the LRB trademarks, logos and band name.<ref name="Federal"/> Housden provided documentation showing the assignment of those trademarks to We Two, registered by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in 1989,<ref name="AutoIM-5"/> and Birtles' transfer of ownership of the url "littleriverband.com" to We Two in 2000.<ref name="AutoIM-6"/>

The parties settled out of court on 13 June 2002 where We Two had ownership of the Little River Band name, trademarks and logos and that Birtles, Goble and Shorrock could reference their history in advertising separate to BSG's name but only in a descriptive manner.<ref name="Kruger BSG"/><ref name="Sams"/><ref name="Federal"/> On 12 July of that year Birtles, Goble and Shorrock were directed to pay half of We Two's taxed costs.<ref name="Federal"/> A further legal case in late July 2005 was also settled out of court which allowed the trio to advertise their Little River Band connection but not to perform under that name.<ref name="Eliezer"/> The three former members shared their frustration at the situation via song, with Goble's "Someone's Taken Our History",<ref name="Goble Taken"/> Birtles' "Revolving Door"<ref name="Birtles Door"/> and Shorrock's "Hear My Voice".<ref name="AutoIM-7"/>

At the end of 2004, Murphy and Reither left LRB and [[Chris Marion]] joined on keyboards, while Kip Raines briefly took on drumming duties until replaced by Billy Thomas in early 2005. Housden stopped touring with the band in 2006 but still participated in their recordings and management. Rich Herring took over lead guitar on tour and Mel Watts replaced Thomas, who had suffered a shoulder injury, on drums in 2007. Ryan Ricks replaced Watts in 2012.

The group self released a Christmas album, ''We Call It Christmas'', in November 2007 and a five song EP, ''Outback'', in December 2009.

''Lehigh Valley Music''{{'}}s reviewer John Moser saw their performance in early 2013. He perceived that they largely played material from before 1985 and were unable to deliver improvements on the originals.<ref name="AutoIM-8"/> That August, LRB released the album ''Cuts Like a Diamond'' on the Frontiers Records, a majority of which was written by other musicians.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Little River Band were scheduled to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' in January 2015 to promote the group's 40th anniversary. It was cancelled after complaints from early members over advertising that LRB would perform "Reminiscing".<ref name="Wardlaw 1"/> Permission for the use of any songs written by Birtles, Briggs, Goble or Shorrock was refused.<ref name="Cornwall"/> Shorrock expressed his concerns over LRB's misrepresentations,<ref name="AutoIM-10"/> "They are promoting a newly recorded album of their own material, or whatever material they have got. They should do that rather than pretend they are the band that sold 30 million albums."<ref name="auto"/>

In March 2015 the group's appearance in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was cancelled after the venue received a [[cease and desist]] order from the early members regarding the use of their recordings in advertising and the demands by LRB members to be paid in full before performing. The venue described the latter demand as "not only unreasonable, but uncustomary".<ref name="Cashmere 2"/> Rahni Sadler of Australian television show ''[[Sunday Night (Australian TV program)|Sunday Night]]'' investigated the band name controversy. She asked Housden to display the document which showed the transfer of ownership but he had not located it.<ref name="Little River Band, no more"/> Wheatley said that he could not remember signing it when it appeared in the court case.<ref name="Little River Band, no more"/><ref name="AutoIM-11"/><ref name="AutoIM-12"/> Shorrock offered to make peace with Housden and perform together.<ref name="Little River Band, no more"/> Housden told Sadler that he would not allow the original members to work as Little River Band "in this lifetime".<ref name="auto" /><ref name="AutoIM-13"/> Housden and Nelson acknowledged that the later version of the band would not be successful without the songs of the founders.<ref name="Little River Band, no more"/>

In September 2015, Little River Band received Casino Musical Entertainer of the Year at the Annual G2E Awards ceremony at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.<ref name="AutoIM-15"/> As of 2017, LRB continue to tour, mostly in the US, performing more than 80 concerts annually and re-recording earlier material.<ref name="AutoIM-16"/><ref name="AutoIM-17"/> When asked about LRB's ''Hits Revisited'' album, Birtles disparaged it saying, "That to me is the comedy album ... They re-arranged all the songs and it's bloody awful. They're nothing more than a tribute band."<ref name=":0"/> Also in 2017, Little River Band [[Geo-blocking|blocked]] Australia from its official website.<ref name="AutoIM-21"/> Australian access to the band's Facebook page was also blocked.<ref name="AutoIM-22"/>

On 13 November 2017, Birtles on Australian talk show ''[[Studio 10]]'' confirmed that the founders would not reunite, saying that "Once [BSG] folded we all realised it wasn't going to go any further than that. It's unfortunate how we lost the name and everything, but if it's ruled in the court that way all you can do is walk away from it."<ref name="AutoIM-23"/>

In February 2018, Herring in ''Everyone Loves Guitar'' disclosed that "We actually re-recorded all the hits and I'll say without any shame that I tried to make it sound as close to the originals as possible by bringing in background singers that actually sounded like those guys did 30-40 years ago. I'm pretty proud of it."<ref name="AutoIM-25"/>

Nashville musician Colin Whinnery was recruited to replace Hind on vocals and guitar in 2018, consequently there are no Australians in Little River Band.<ref name="AutoIM-26"/>

In January 2019 an agent for Goble, Birtles and Shorrock applied to the Australian Trademark Office to register "Little River Band" as a trademark.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Little River Band Trademark Registration|url=https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/1983134|access-date=21 June 2021|website=www.ipaustralia.gov.au|language=en}}</ref> Little River Band Pty Ltd had current registered trademarks for "Little River Band". The application sought to have the existing Little River Band trademarks removed, alleging non-use in the three-year period ending in December 2018. On 17 May 2021 the Australian Trademark Office ruled in favour of Little River Band Pty Ltd's opposition to the application for removal of their "Little River Band" trademarks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Little River Band Pty Ltd v Victor Marshall|url=http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/ATMO/2021/39.html|access-date=21 June 2021|website=www8.austlii.edu.au|language=en}}</ref>

In December 2020, ''Rolling Stone Australia'' magazine reported that "the songwriters responsible for the band's biggest songs – Graeham Goble, Glenn Shorrock, Beeb Birtles and David Briggs – are unable to perform as the Little River Band, the band they themselves invented back in 1974!

[[File:LRB Aria.jpg|thumb|250px|Former members of Little River Band performing at their induction into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]], 17 October 2004]]
The Little River Band are considered to be among Australia's most significant bands. As of September 2004 they have sold more than 30 million records<ref name="Sams"/> and scored 13 US Top 40 hits.<ref name="Music VF"/> In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named "Cool Change" as one of the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time.<ref name="Kruger"/> At that ceremony Goble and Shorrock reconnected after ten&nbsp;years; they proposed a reunion with Birtles to perform their earlier material, which became the trio Birtles Shorrock Goble.<ref name="Kruger BSG"/>

At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2004]], Little River Band were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Sams"/><ref name="HoF"/> The presentation acknowledged the band's three decade career and thirteen official members and was accepted by the 1976 to 1978 line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Pellicci, McArdle and Shorrock. They were referred to as "The Classic Line-up of the Little River Band".<ref name="auto1"/> They performed "Help Is on Its Way" at the ceremony on 17 October 2004. Shorrock had previously been inducted in [[ARIA Music Awards of 1991|1991]] for his work with the Twilights, Axiom and his solo career.<ref name="HoF"/> Farnham, who had been inducted in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2003|2003]] for his solo work, was not inducted in 2004 with Little River Band.<ref name="HoF"/> However, Farnham's contribution to LRB was acknowledged by Goble in his acceptance speech. The 2018 version of Little River Band claims the band's Hall of Fame induction, amongst other past achievements, on its website.<ref name="AutoIM-35"/>

With more than five&nbsp;million plays, "Reminiscing", written by Goble, was recognised by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI) as one of the most frequently played songs in the history of US radio, the highest achievement of any Australian pop song internationally.<ref name="Kruger Reminiscing"/><ref name="AutoIM-39"/> According to [[Albert Goldman]]'s biography, John Lennon named "Reminiscing" as one of his favourite songs. [[May Pang]], Lennon's erstwhile girlfriend, said they considered "Reminiscing" as "our song".<ref name="Asianace"/> "[[Lady (Little River Band song)|Lady]]" has accumulated more than four&nbsp;million plays.<ref name="AutoIM-39"/><ref name="BMI Lady"/>

LRB were mentioned in the 2010 film ''[[The Other Guys]]'', when the character portrayed by [[Will Ferrell]] played "Reminiscing" while driving. The character portrayed by [[Mark Wahlberg]] threw the CD out the window, but Ferrell's character played it again later on and said that he always had six identical LRB CDs in his car. In ''Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations'' (2019), Admiral [[William H. McRaven]] wrote that he would sing "[[Happy Anniversary (Little River Band song)|Happy Anniversary]]" before every jump.<ref name="AutoIM-36"/>

Shorrock was appointed a member of the Order of Australia (AM) on 26 January 2020, awarded for significant service to the performing arts as a singer, songwriter and entertainer.<ref name="AutoIM-37"/> In March 2020 he was due to perform at the Little River Country Fair in the town after which LRB were named. Shorrock wanted to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the group's first show. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the performance was postponed.<ref name="AutoIM-38"/> In September, Goble was acknowledged for achieving 12&nbsp;million plays of his songs on US commercial radio by BMI after receiving his fifth such Million-Air Award, with the latest for "The Night Owls" (see their [[List of awards and nominations received by Little River Band#BMI Awards|BMI Awards]]).<ref name="AutoIM-39"/>
