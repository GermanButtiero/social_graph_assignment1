'''Iron Maiden''' are<!-- Please refer to WP:ENGVAR. British English uses the plural format while referring to rock bands. Please do not change "are" to "is". --> an English [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Leyton]], [[East London]], in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]]. Although fluid in the early years of the band, the line-up for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]], drummer [[Nicko McBrain]], and guitarists [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], [[Adrian Smith (musician)|Adrian Smith]] and [[Janick Gers]]. As pioneers of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement, Iron Maiden released a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980's [[Iron Maiden (album)|debut album]], 1981's ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', and 1982's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' – its first album with Dickinson, who in 1981 replaced [[Paul Di'Anno]] as lead singer. The addition of Dickinson was a turning point in their career, establishing them as one of heavy metal's most important bands. ''The Number of the Beast'' is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.

After some turbulence in the 1990s, the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999 saw the band undergo a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours. Their three most recent albums — ''[[The Final Frontier]]'' (2010), ''[[The Book of Souls]]'' (2015), and ''[[Senjutsu (album)|Senjutsu]]'' (2021) — have all reached number&nbsp;1 in more than 25 countries. Iron Maiden have sold over 130&nbsp;million copies of their albums worldwide and have obtained over&nbsp;600 [[music recording certification|certifications]]. The band is considered to be one of the most influential and revered heavy metal bands of all time. They have received multiple industry awards, including the [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] and [[Brit Awards]].

The band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four [[Extended play|EPs]] and seven [[compilation album|compilations]]. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums, and two video games. Iron Maiden's lyrics cover such topics as history, literature, war, mythology, dark fantasy, science fiction, society and religion. {{as of|2019|October|}}, the band have played [[List of Iron Maiden concert tours|2,500 live shows]]. For over 40&nbsp;years the band have featured their signature mascot, "[[Eddie (Iron Maiden)|Eddie]]", on the covers of almost all of their releases.

==History==
===Early years (1975–1978)===
[[File:Cartandhorses.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cart and Horses]], located in Maryland Point, [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976. The building was officially named "The Birthplace of Iron Maiden".{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=29|2a1=Bushell|2a2=Halfin|2y=1985|2p=9}}]]

Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975, by bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], as the title reminded him of the [[iron maiden|iron maiden torture device]].{{sfn|Barton|1979}} They originally used the name Ash Mountain, but most of the band members preferred the name Iron Maiden. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} before taking up a semi-residency at the [[Cart and Horses]] Pub in [[Maryland, London|Maryland]], [[Stratford, London|Stratford]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=29}} The original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist [[Paul Mario Day]] being the first to go as, according to Harris, he lacked "energy or charisma on stage".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used makeup and fake blood during live performances{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} and had earlier played with Harris and Doug Sampson in the band Smiler.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-02-27 |title=Interview: Steve Harris on Iron Maiden's Foundation {{!}} Bacon's Archive |url=https://reverb.com/news/interview-iron-maidens-steve-harris |access-date=2024-12-08 |website=reverb.com |language=en}}</ref> Wilcock's friend, guitarist [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-serving members and have performed on all of their releases.

[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] in [[Somewhere Back in Time World Tour|2008]]. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]
Iron Maiden recruited another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.{{sfn|EMI|2004}} A new line-up was put together, including future [[Cutting Crew]] member [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] (better known today as Thunderstick). After a single gig with the band in January 1978, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} Dave Murray rejoined in late March 1978, and when Terry Wapram disapproved he was sacked. A few weeks later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, with Wapram, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] also left. Former Smiler drummer Doug Sampson was at Dennis' and Thunderstick's last gig, and joined the band afterwards.

Harris, Murray and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion, a pub in [[Leytonstone]], in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=54}} Steve Harris said, "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=53}} At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=64}}

===Record contract and early releases (1978–1981)===
{{main|The Soundhouse Tapes|Iron Maiden (album)|Killers (Iron Maiden album)}}

On New Year's Eve, 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a four-song demo at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} the band gave a copy to [[Neal Kay]], who, at the time, was managing a heavy metal club called "Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=67}} After hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, "Prowler", eventually went to number&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=104–105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=83}} As Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'', named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=103}} Featuring only three tracks (one song, "Strange World", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=102}} all 5,000 copies sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=104–105}}

[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and Steve Harris supporting [[Judas Priest]] on their [[British Steel Tour]], 1980]]
In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]]{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, [[Adrian Smith (musician)|Adrian Smith]] of [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=163–164}} Busy with his own band, Smith declined and [[Dennis Stratton]] was hired instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=121}} Shortly after, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues and was replaced by ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an EMI album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]" and "Wrathchild".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=137}} The release led to a [[Metal for Muthas Tour|tour]] including several other bands linked with the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=139|2a1=Saulnier|2y=2012}}

Iron Maiden released their [[Iron Maiden (album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, which debuted at number&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=143}} In addition to the title track, the album included other early favourites such as "[[Running Free]]", "Transylvania", "Phantom of the Opera" and "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]" – which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,{{sfn|Hinchcliffe|1999}} and was replaced by Smith in October 1980. In December, the band played at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, where their first live video was filmed. ''[[Live at the Rainbow]]'' was released in May 1981, and "Iron Maiden" and "Wrathchild" from this video received heavy rotation on [[MTV]] during its first hours on the air as the first metal videos ever.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|Roland|2013}}

[[File:Iron Maiden, Steve Harris - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|Iron Maiden on stage, [[Killer World Tour]] 1981]]
In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Although many tracks were written prior to their debut release, it had two new songs: "Prodigal Son" and "Murders in the Rue Morgue"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=183}} (the latter's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).{{sfn|Brannigan}} Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=181}} who would continue to work with Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]] with their debut performance in the United States opening for Judas Priest at the [[PH Live|Aladdin Theatre]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]]. ''Killers'' marked the band's USA album charts debut, reaching number&nbsp;78 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],{{sfn|Billboard}} and they booked 132 shows to promote the album, including their first concert in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Tour1981|2021}} During the summer, Iron Maiden played several festivals in Europe, including at the Golden Summernights 1981 festivals at [[Zeppelinfeld]] in [[Nuremberg]] in front of 100,000 people.{{Sfn|DDotB|2021}}

===Success (1981–1985)===
{{main|The Number of the Beast (album)|Piece of Mind|Powerslave|Live After Death}}
[[File:Iron Maiden in San Sebastian.jpg|thumb|Stage set 1982]]

By 1981, [[Paul Di'Anno]] was demonstrating increasingly erratic behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} about which Di'Anno comments, "It wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day&nbsp;... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=194}} Di'Anno was dismissed following the Killer World Tour{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} with the band already having selected his replacement.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}} After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=217}} [[Bruce Dickinson]], formerly of [[Samson (band)|Samson]], auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}} The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy and a one-off show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played "Children of the Damned" and "22 Acacia Avenue", introducing fans to their new material.{{sfn|Dome|2014}}

In 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', which became the band's first number&nbsp;1 record on the UK Albums Chart,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=227}} was a Top 10 hit in many other countries, and reached number&nbsp;33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}}{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a "moral contribution" to "Children of the Damned", "The Prisoner", and "[[Run to the Hills]]".{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=82}} The band embarked on a world tour, dubbed The Beast on the Road, with shows in North America, Japan, Australia and Europe, including a headline appearance for 40,000 people at the [[Reading festival|Reading Festival]]. Iron Maiden played 188 shows in 10 months.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} The Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed Iron Maiden were [[Satanism|Satanic]] because of the new album's title track and "demonic" cover art,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} and a group of Christian [[activism|activists]] destroyed Iron Maiden records in protest.{{sfn|Young(1)}} Dickinson later said the band treated this as "silliness"{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} and the demonstrations in fact gave them "loads of publicity".{{sfn|EMI|2004}} ''The Number of the Beast'' sold 2.5 million copies in its first year, 14 million by 2010, and 20 million by 2022.{{sfn|39Anos|2021}}{{sfn|Pfanner|2010}}{{sfn|NOTB40CS|2022}}{{sfn|TNOTB40|2022}}

[[File:Nicko McBrain 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nicko McBrain]] was Iron Maiden's drummer from 1982.]]
In December 1982, drummer [[Clive Burr]] was fired from the band and replaced by [[Nicko McBrain]], who previously played for [[Trust (French band)|Trust]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=233}} Although Harris said the dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=232–233}} Burr later claimed he was unfairly ousted from the band.{{sfn|Marlow|2011}} The band then recorded the first of three consecutive albums at [[Compass Point Studios]] in the Bahamas.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=246}} In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', which reached the number&nbsp;3 spot in the UK{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=247}} and number&nbsp;14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}} ''Piece of Mind'' features the singles "[[The Trooper]]" and "[[Flight of Icarus]]", the latter being one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=245}} Iron Maiden played 147 concerts in Europe and North America as a part of the World Piece Tour. This was also their first major North American tour as headliners, selling out [[Madison Square Garden]] with a crowd of 20,000.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|WPT|2021}}

After the success of ''Piece of Mind'' and its supporting tour, the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'', on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles "[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]" and "[[Aces High (song)|Aces High]]", the title track, and "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem ''[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'').{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} ''Powerslave'' was another chart success, reaching number&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]{{sfn|Billboard}} and eventually number&nbsp;1 in the UK.{{sfn|Powerslave Charts |2024}}{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=253–255}}{{sfn|PS1|2024}} The band's fifth studio album sold over 4 million copies in its first year after the premiere.{{Sfn|40PS|2024}} The tour following the album, called [[World Slavery Tour]], was the band's largest to date with 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.{{sfn|LouderSound|2021}}{{sfn|Stenning 1|2006|p=102}} Many shows were played back to back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts at [[Long Beach Arena]] for a combined audience of 54,000 fans.{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}} Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined the [[Rock in Rio]] festival with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for an audience estimated at 350,000–500,000 people.{{sfn|RiRAt|2022}}{{sfn|EMI|2008}} The tour started in August 1984 with five shows in Poland. Iron Maiden were the first Western artists to bring full-scale production behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. The band's third official video, entitled ''[[Behind the Iron Curtain (video)|Behind the Iron Curtain]]'', was released in October 1984. The World Slavery Tour documentary brought footage of the band touring Eastern Europe in 1984, performing shows in the countries visited, ''Behind the Iron Curtain'' was the first documentary ever published by a Western artist that showed them touring the countries of [[Eastern Bloc]]. The documentary movie was broadcast by [[MTV]] and local TV stations around the world.{{Sfn|1984T|2023}}

The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=258}} This was the first substantial touring break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,{{sfn|Stenning 2|2006|p=104}} with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=255}} In October 1985, Iron Maiden released the double live album and home video, ''[[Live After Death]]''. A critical and commercial success, it peaked at number&nbsp;19 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''{{sfn|Billboard}} and number&nbsp;2 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=257}} The album was recorded at [[Long Beach Arena]] and also features additional tracks from four nights at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo]].{{sfn|LAD|2021|p=193}}{{sfn|Live Coll|2021}} In November 1985, Iron Maiden were named the best rock and metal band in the world and awarded at Public Choice International.{{sfn|IPCH1985|2021}}

===Experimentation (1986–1989)===
{{main|Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son}}
Returning from their time off, the band added different musical elements to their 1986 studio album, ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]].'' These focused on [[Synthesiser|synthesised]] bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.{{sfn|Huey(3)}} The release performed well across the world, particularly the single "[[Wasted Years]]", but included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}} The album was the band's biggest American chart success to date, reaching number&nbsp;11 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''{{sfn|Billboard}} and number&nbsp;2 in the UK charts.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=257}}{{sfn|SS35Y|2023}} The [[Somewhere on Tour]] was also a success. The band played 157 shows for over two and a half million fans, including eighty-one shows in North America. Once again, Iron Maiden visited Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia to play for tens of thousands of fans in each country.{{Sfn|SiTT|2023}} The experimentation evident on ''Somewhere in Time'' continued on their next album, ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which was released in 1988. A [[concept album]] recorded at [[Musicland Studios]] in Munich{{sfn|Musiclands|2021}} and based on the 1987 novel ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]],{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} it was the band's first record to include keyboards, which were performed by Harris and Smith.{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} Dickinson's enthusiasm was also renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's third album to hit number&nbsp;1 in the UK charts{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=263}} and reached number&nbsp;12 on the ''[[Billboard 200]].''{{sfn|Billboard}}

During the following [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|tour]], the band headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Donington Park]] on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history (107,000).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC Arena]], Birmingham, recorded for a live video, entitled ''[[Maiden England]]''. The video debuted at top spots of worldwide music videos charts.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=272}} In May, the group set out on a [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|supporting tour]], which saw them perform 103 shows to well over two million people worldwide over seven months.<ref name="plucky seven">{{cite journal |title= Plucky Seven |journal= [[Kerrang!]] |date= 16 April 1988 |first= Mick |last= Wall |author-link=Mick Wall| issue= 183 |page= 45}}</ref> To recreate the album's keyboards onstage throughout the tour, the group recruited Michael Kenney, Steve Harris' bass technician; Kenney has served as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums.{{sfn|Gennet|2010}}

===Upheaval (1989–1994)===
{{main|No Prayer for the Dying|Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)}}

During a break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], entitled ''[[Silver and Gold (ASAP album)|Silver and Gold]].''{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=273}} Vocalist Bruce Dickinson also began work on a solo album with former [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist [[Janick Gers]], releasing ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'' in 1990,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=281}} followed by a tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} At the same time, to mark the band's 10-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, ''[[The First Ten Years (boxed set)|The First Ten Years]]'', a series of 10 CDs and double [[12-inch single]]s. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one by one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original [[B-side]]s.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

Iron Maiden then began work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris regarding the direction the band should be taking. Smith disagreed with the "stripped down" style they were leaning towards.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith and became the band's first new member in seven years.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} The album ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'' was released in October 1990.{{sfn|Prato}} It contained the hit singles "[[Holy Smoke (song)|Holy Smoke]]" and "[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]", the band's first – and, to date, only – [[UK Singles Chart]] number&nbsp;1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo project for the soundtrack of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=282}} Iron Maiden's eighth studio album debuted at number&nbsp;2 on the UK albums chart{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=282}} and number&nbsp;17 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''.{{sfn|Billboard}} ''No Prayer for the Dying'' was a return to their musical roots, especially in the simplicity of composition.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} The No Prayer on the Road tour was booked for 120 shows in Europe, North America, and Japan. Thirty-three shows in continental Europe were sold out with a reported 530,000 fans attending.{{sfn|1990EU|2021}} In total, Iron Maiden played for some two million fans.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=287}}{{sfn|1990EU|2021}}

After another break, the band recorded their next studio album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', which was released in 1992. The title track became a regular part of the band's concert setlists. Achieving their fourth number&nbsp;1 on the UK albums chart and number&nbsp;12 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'',{{sfn|Billboard}}{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=289}} the release also included the number&nbsp;2 single "[[Be Quick or Be Dead]]", the number&nbsp;21 single "[[From Here to Eternity (Iron Maiden song)|From Here to Eternity]]", and the softer "[[Wasting Love]]".{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=288–290}} The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The [[Fear of the Dark Tour|extensive worldwide tour that followed]] included their first-ever Latin American leg, although Christian organisations prevented Iron Maiden from performing in Chile and accused them of being "emissaries of satanic propaganda",{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2011(2)}} and headlining the [[Monsters of Rock]] festivals in seven European countries.{{sfn|MOR1992|2021}} Iron Maiden's second performance at [[Donington Park]], for a sold-out audience of 75,000,{{sfn|FotDCDROM|2021}}{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}} was filmed for the audio and video release ''[[Live at Donington (Iron Maiden album)|Live at Donington]]'' and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform "Running Free".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}} The tour also saw conflicts between Bruce Dickinson and rest of the band.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|DarkEra|2021}}

In 1993, Dickinson left the band to pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', was released in March 1993 and featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and the second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', was released after Dickinson left the band and featured songs from 1980 to 1984. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=296}} Dickinson denied he was under-performing, saying it was impossible to "make like Mr. Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right", and that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=297}} Dickinson played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993. The show was filmed, broadcast by the [[BBC]], [[MTV]] and released on video under the name ''[[Raising Hell (video)|Raising Hell]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=298}}

===Difficulties (1994–1999)===
{{main|The X Factor (album)|Virtual XI}}
[[File:Blaze Bayley Eternal Flame.jpg|thumb|Blaze Bayley, Iron Maiden frontman from 1994 to 1999]]

In 1994, the title track from the ''Fear of the Dark'' album received a [[Grammy Awards]] nomination for "Best Metal Performance", a first for Iron Maiden.{{Sfn|1994G|2024}} The band listened to the thousands of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing [[Blaze Bayley]], formerly of the band [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]], who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=301}} Harris' preferred choice from the outset,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=302}} Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor and ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(b)}}

After a three-year hiatus – a record for the band at the time – Iron Maiden released their next studio album, ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]''. The band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK, debuting at number&nbsp;8; however, the album went on to win "Album of the Year" awards in France, Spain and Germany.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=311–313}} The record included the 11-minute epic "Sign of the Cross", the band's longest song since "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", as well as the singles "[[Man on the Edge]]" (based on the film ''[[Falling Down]]''){{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=44}} and "[[Lord of the Flies (song)|Lord of the Flies]]", based on the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.{{sfn|Popoff|2005(b)}} The release is notable for its "dark" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing their first shows in Israel and South Africa as well as Malta, Bulgaria and Romania in Europe, before concluding in the Americas. The biggest show of the whole tour was a headline appearance for 60,000 people at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in [[São Paulo]], Brazil. ''The X Factor'' sold 1.3 million copies, the lowest sales result since 1981.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=314–315}} After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, ''[[Best of the Beast]]''. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, "[[Virus (Iron Maiden song)|Virus]]", in which the lyrics attack critics who had recently written off the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=316}}

In 1998, Iron Maiden released ''[[Virtual XI]]'', whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(a)}}{{sfn|Sverigetopplistan}} The album peaked at number&nbsp;16 in the UK, the band's lowest for a new studio record.{{sfn|Official Charts Company|1998}} At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including ''Live at Donington''.{{sfn|Saulnier|2010}} Bayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=324}} The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the [[Virtual XI World Tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=321}} although Janick Gers said this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2010}}

===Reunion and renewed success (1999–2005)===

Not satisfied with the results from Harris' Barnyard Studios, located on his property in Essex,{{sfn|Berelian|2000}} which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release, ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'', at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer [[Kevin Shirley]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=341}} Iron Maiden continued to find inspiration in movies and books, as shown in songs like "[[The Wicker Man (song)|The Wicker Man]]" – based on the 1973 British cult film ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' – and "Brave New World" – a title taken from the [[Aldous Huxley]] novel ''[[Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=342}} The album revisited the more progressive and melodic sound featured in some earlier recordings, along with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=342}} The album was a commercial and artistic success.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=342–344}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

Iron Maiden's distinct logo has adorned all of the band's releases since their debut, 1979's ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'' EP. The typeface originates with [[Vic Fair]]'s poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'',{{sfn|Meansheets|2010}} also used by [[Gordon Giltrap]], although Steve Harris claims he designed it himself, using his training as an architectural draughtsman.{{sfn|EMI|1998}}

===Influence on other artists and the genre===
Iron Maiden have influenced numerous artists and bands representing different genres of rock and metal music. [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] co-founder [[Paul Stanley]] said Iron Maiden "have helped spawn an entire genre of music" and influenced literally thousands of other artists.{{sfn|Kiss Stanley|2021}}{{sfn|IMINF|2022}} According to ''[[Guitar World]]'', Iron Maiden's music has "influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like [[Metallica]] to current stars like [[Avenged Sevenfold]]."{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} Metallica members [[Lars Ulrich]], [[Kirk Hammett]], and [[Jason Newsted]] have cited Iron Maiden as a major influence on their work.{{sfn|Kerrang!|2008}}{{sfn|Metallica's Achievements|2021}}{{sfn|KirkHammett|2022}}{{sfn|JNM|2023}} Other bands and artists directly influenced by Iron Maiden include [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]],{{sfn|ForgeMaid|2022}}{{sfn|GHIM|2022}} Avenged Sevenfold,<ref>{{cite web |date=24 March 2018 |title=Avenged Sevenfold Vocalist Keeps His Politics Out Of Band's Music |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/avenged-sevenfold-vocalist-keeps-his-politics-out-of-bands-music/ |access-date=24 June 2018 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> [[In Flames]],{{sfn|Metal Update|2010}} [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]],{{sfn|Young(2)}}{{sfn|Lilker|2022}} [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]],{{sfn|Exodus on Maiden|2021}} [[Alice in Chains]], {{sfn|AiCH|2022}} and [[Dream Theater]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/john-petrucci-names-two-guitarists-who-make-his-jaw-drop-opens-up-on-dream-theaters-key-influences|title=John Petrucci Names Two Guitarists Who Make His Jaw Drop, Opens Up on Dream Theater's Key Influences|website=[[Ultimate Guitar]]}}</ref>

Journalist [[Geoff Barton]] says the band's music constituted an important passage between the classic heavy rock school during the 1960s and 1970s, based on rhythm and blues, and contemporary heavy metal, characterised by sub-genre diversification and stylistic eclecticism.{{sfn|Barton|2015|p=150}} Music journalist Götz Kühnemund said "Iron Maiden were (and still are) the inspiration for all the heavy metal bands we know today because they're an intrinsically heavy metal group. They're equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, nu metal, metal core and hard rock – almost every genre." The journalist stated the band introduced a [[DIY]] approach to all rock music.{{sfn|PopoffNWOBHM|2019}} According to [[Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp]] the style and attitude of Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain has inspired generations of heavy-metal drummers that followed.{{sfn|RNRFC|2021}} Music writer, heavy metal expert and radio broadcaster Scott Penfold stated band's "influence on the genre is immeasurable, as they not only inspired subsequent generations of metal bands but also revolutionized live shows with their elaborate stage productions, further cementing their status as pioneers of heavy metal."{{sfn|SPenfold|2024}}

Music journalist and the writer [[Neil Daniels]] said Iron Maiden "redefined the whole genre blending classic heavy rock influence with punky vibe, twin guitars attack and progressive approach which finally have created the new quality. [The] Band's influence on generations of rock and metal bands cannot be overstated. They elevated metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist."{{sfn|80sDecade|2022}} The band's profile by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] says "in the 1980s, Iron Maiden released seven high-octane albums that cemented them as one of the greatest rock bands – creating a blueprint for how heavy metal bands should look, sound and tour."{{sfn|RnRHoF Note|2021}} According to ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' Iron Maiden is the second band to [[Black Sabbath]], which has had the most significant impact on metal and heavy rock music.{{sfn|MHIM|2024}}

===Appearance in media===
The first heavy metal videos broadcast by [[MTV]] were the live versions of "Iron Maiden" and "Wrathchild" taken from the official VHS ''[[Live at the Rainbow|Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden)]]''.{{sfn|MTV|2021}}{{sfn|List25|2021}} In 1989, Iron Maiden took part in the [[Rock Aid Armenia]] project (also known as [[Live Aid Armenia]]) - a humanitarian project by the British music industry. The project aimed to raise funds to help people affected by the earthquake in [[Armenia]] in 1988.{{sfn|RAAR|2023}}

The number of releases in tribute to the British band can be estimated in the hundreds, with an extremely wide range of stylistic variants.{{sfn|Tribute1|2021}}{{sfn|Tribute2|2021}} In 2008, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' released ''[[Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden]]'', an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], [[Coheed and Cambria]], Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band.{{sfn|Kerrang!|2008}} In 2010, [[Maiden uniteD]], an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of [[Ayreon]], [[Threshold (band)|Threshold]] and [[Within Temptation]], released ''[[Mind the Acoustic Pieces]]'', a re-interpretation of the entire ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' album.{{sfn|Maiden United}} As of 2021 nearly 200 Iron Maiden cover audio-visual releases exist (each featuring various artists), including piano,{{sfn|AllMusic}} electro,{{sfn|Aquarius Records}} string quartet{{sfn|Loftus}} and hip-hop tributes.{{sfn|AllMusic(2)}}

On 14 March 2025, Iron Maiden announced a feature documentary film created in cooperation with [[Universal Pictures|Universal Pictures Content Group]], which holds global rights, and [[Universal Pictures International]]. The documentary is set to release in cinemas worldwide in the Fall of 2025, and was directed by [[Malcolm Venville]] and produced by Dominic Freeman. Helen Parker, known as EVP Universal Pictures Content Group, was chosen as executive producer.{{sfn|Docum|2025}} According to Thames & Hudson, the visual book entitled "Iron Maiden: Infinite Dreams – The Official Visual History" will be published in the same period accompanying the movie.{{sfn|IDBook|2025}}

===Claims of Satanic references===
The 1982 release of ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' created some controversy for the band. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as [[Satanism|Satanists]], encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.{{sfn|Young(1)}} The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later said the groups initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers due to fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eagle Vision|1y=2001|2a1=Young(1)}} The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2011(2)}}

The band have always denied the notion they are Satanists, with lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson doing so on-stage in the ''[[Live After Death]]'' concert video.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} Steve Harris has since commented that "It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} Harris has also said that "[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=224}} and also influenced by [[Robert Burns]]' "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]".{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} The band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.{{sfn|Godscare}}

===Ed Force One===
[[File:Boeing 757-23A, Astraeus AN1497690.jpg|thumb|The band's former Ed Force One, a [[Boeing 757-200]]]]

For their [[Somewhere Back in Time World Tour]] in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an [[Astraeus Airlines]] [[Boeing 757]]<!-- The first two Ed Force Ones were Boeing 757s.

[[File:Boeing747-IronMaiden01.jpg|thumb|left|Iron Maiden's Ed Force One, a [[Boeing 747-400]], as used during The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016]]
The aircraft, named "Ed Force One" after a competition on the band's website,{{sfn|Cashmere|2008}} was flown by Dickinson until 2022,{{sfn|EF1B|2022}} as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus; the plane also appears in the documentary{{sfnm|1a1=Juno Awards|1y=2010|2a1=Bezer|2y=2009c}} ''[[Iron Maiden: Flight 666]]''.{{sfn|Bezer|2009a}} For [[The Book of Souls World Tour]] in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-[[Air France]] [[Boeing 747-400]] jumbo jet{{sfnm|1a1=Sands|1y=2016}} which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.{{sfn|Lach|2015b}}

In 2025, the band announced that the 747-400 they used during 2016's The Book of Souls World Tour would be scrapped, and [[keychain]]s constructed from the plane's parts could be collected by fans. "She's been scrapped but bits of her will live on," Dickinson said. The keychains were sold for €66.66, which is a reference to the band's album [[The Number of the Beast (album)|The ''Number of the Beast'']].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alpert |first=Lukas I. |date=2025-03-19 |title=Run to the hills!

Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter,{{sfn|MusicRadar|2010}} has said his influences include [[Black Sabbath]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Wishbone Ash]] and [[Golden Earring]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brannigan |first1=Paul |title=Iron Maiden's Steve Harris: 8 songs that changed my life |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-8-songs-that-changed-my-life |website=loudersound |access-date=9 May 2022 |language=en |date=24 June 2021}}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Blabbermouth.net|1y=2004c|2a1=EMI|2y=2004|3a1=Wall|3y=2004|3p=27|4a1=Wall|4y=2004|4p=154}} Iron Maiden covered a song by Golden Earring called "Kill Me Ce Soir" on the B-side of the single "[[Holy Smoke (song)|Holy Smoke]]". In 2010 Harris said, "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's ''[[Argus (album)|Argus]]'' album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it."{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} In 2004, Harris explained the band's "heaviness" was inspired by "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in."{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2004c}} Harris also developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as "more like a rhythm guitar."{{sfn|Popoff|2005(c)}} Harris's bass technique is responsible for the band's galloping style,{{sfn|Fender}} heard in such songs as "[[The Trooper]]"{{sfn|Huey(2)}} and "Run to the Hills".{{sfn|Lawson}}

The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing styles. Dave Murray is known for his [[legato]] technique which, he says, "evolved naturally. I'd heard [[Jimi Hendrix]] using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing."{{sfn|McIver|2010(a)}} Stating that he "was inspired by [[blues rock]] rather than metal," Adrian Smith was influenced by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Pat Travers]], leading to him becoming a "melodic player."{{sfn|McIver|2010(c)}} Janick Gers prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by [[Ritchie Blackmore]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=277}} which he says is in contrast to Smith's "rhythmic" sound.{{sfn|McIver|2010(b)}}

Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=244}} has an [[operatic]] vocal style, inspired by [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Ian Anderson]] and [[Ian Gillan]],{{sfn|Dmme.net}} and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.{{sfnm|1a1=Rosen|1y=2011|2a1=HearYa.com|2y=2006|3a1=Blabbermouth.net|3y=2009a|4a1=Blabbermouth.net|4y=2009b}} Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the ''Dance of Death'' album,{{sfn|Ling|2005b}} Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, "Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=241}}

Throughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, although the addition of [[guitar synthesiser]]s on 1986's ''Somewhere in Time'',{{sfn|Prato}} keyboards on 1988's ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} and an attempt to return to the "stripped down" production of their earlier material on {{notatypo|1990's}} ''No Prayer for the Dying'' marked some experimentation.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} In recent years, however, the band have begun using more [[progressive rock|progressive]] elements in their songs,{{sfnm|1a1=Dome|1y=2006a|2a1=Dome|2y=2006b}} which Steve Harris describes as not progressive "in the modern sense, but like [[Dream Theater]], more in a 70s way".{{sfn|Dome|2006b}} Greg Prato of [[Ultimate Guitar|Ultimate-Guitar]] wrote, "By and large, Iron Maiden's long and lengthy career can be categorized into two separate eras: "punk Maiden" and "prog Maiden".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 5 New Wave of British Heavy Metal Tunes |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/top_5_new_wave_of_british_heavy_metal_tunes-167070 |access-date=2025-02-10 |website=www.ultimate-guitar.com |language=en}}</ref> According to Harris, ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'' was the band's first album which was "more progressive",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=264}} and they would return to this style in 1995's ''The X Factor'', which he states is "like an extension of ''Seventh Son''..., in the sense of the progressive element to it".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material,{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} which [[AllMusic]] states was "clearly drawing from elements of punk rock",{{sfn|Huey(1)}} although Harris firmly denies this.{{sfn|VH1|2011}}
